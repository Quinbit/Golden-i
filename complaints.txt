The only folks who care if Apple is a trillion dollar company are investors. They're the ones laying bets on the table in buying Apple stock. If Apple fails to meet their own goals, it will - inaccurately - be called a "failure." The United States is one of the only countries on earth where a company can clear half a billion in revenues and still be criticized for such numbers not being big enough.

Apple's fan base will buy what Apple puts in front of them, regardless of its market capitalization. Why? Their friends buy Apple, they see Apple on TV, and the Apple user mantra, "I just want it to work." 

At this point it's also about not wanting to think about making a change. I remember seeing a PSA billboard that said, "I'll quit smoking when cigarettes become $_____ a pack." One could do the same for Apple's iPhone: "I'll consider other smartphones when the iPhone reaches $_____." Apple will continue to raise prices to see just how big that "____" can get - the higher they can get away with on the backs of their customer base, the happier investors will be.The only folks who care if Apple is a trillion dollar company are investors.

Should mean next year the phones become more reasonably priced. The 8 should have kept the 7’s pricing & then the X I’d have said would been fair at the the 8’s current pricing models.

Oh and then the computers just aren’t keeping up with the tech world anymore yet still somehow go up in price on every refresh, when other vendors for Windows are pretty much matching, if not beating Apple now for how a product feels and looks. (Granted if you really need / want Mac OS then Mac is the only route). 

Ever since the watch came about with a model branding a £10,000 price tag, apple have just become even greedier and it shows with the “we’re now a fashion tech company” statement from Cook himself around when the original watch launched.Hope Will doesn't get fucked again by upside down monsters.
