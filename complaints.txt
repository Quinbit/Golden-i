today, attorney general jeff sessions officially announced that $12 million in grants and funding will be provided to help law enforcement tackle certain parts of the opioid crisis, particularly the production and trafficking of the drug on local levels.   there were more drug-related deaths in 2016 than the entire vietnam war and car crashes, gun violence, and hiv/aids ever did in a single year (according to vox). the president declared the opioid problem a “public health emergency” in october of 2017, in contrast to a national emergency, which would have made funds for treatment, prescription monitoring etc. more rapidly available. instead, there has been no substantial funding allocated to combating the issue until this measly attempt.    experts say it will take over $183 billion over ten years to combat this crisis. providing $12 million to this multi-billion dollar problem is like tossing a glass of water on a forest fire. even with the $1 billion drug treatment bill, this crisis is severely underfunded. if this doesn't get sorted out soon, our ability to get this epidemic under control will go up in flames.

this morning donald trump retweeted a series of violent anti-muslim videos. we don't want to re-share them for a number of reasons.   1) we do not know if the videos are authentic   2) they are from a woman who leads a group called, britain first. they are know as anti-muslim and racist.  even longtime trump supporter piers morgan drew the line with these posts. morgan tweeted:  "good morning, mr president @realdonaldtrump - what the hell are you doing retweeting a bunch of unverified videos by britain first, a bunch of disgustingly racist far-right extremists?  please stop this madness & undo your retweets."  israeli newspaper haaretz.com wrote:  one of the first reactions was from the widower of jo cox, the british parliamentarian who was murdered by an assassin who shouted "britain first."    brendan cox wrote, "trump has legitimised the far right in his own country, now he’s trying to do it in ours. spreading hatred has consequences & the president should be ashamed of himself."

after we shared a story this morning about a tax break for those with private jets, one of our news & guts readers brought something to our attention that we wanted to share with you.  roy jones commented, "the bill includes a tax break for private jets but abolishes the $250 tax credit for teachers who buy school supplies for their classrooms. this isn't a tax bill...it's a massive upward transfer of wealth bill."  we did a little digging and found he is correct. the bill that passed the house yesterday does eliminate the deduction for teachers buying school supplies, but the senate version raises the deduction. what will happen in the end?   this blog from education week has much more on the effect these tax bills could have on education and educators.

conservationists and animal groups are reacting to an abc news report that says, "the trump administration plans to allow hunters to import trophies of elephants they killed in zimbabwe and zambia back to the united states, reversing a ban put in place by the obama administration in 2014, a u.s. fish and wildlife service official confirmed to abc news today."  the humane society of the united states issued a statement saying:  "let’s be clear: elephants are on the list of threatened species; the global community has rallied to stem the ivory trade; and now, the u.s. government is giving american trophy hunters the green light to kill them.  what kind of message does it send to say to the world that poor africans who are struggling to survive cannot kill elephants in order to use or sell their parts to make a living, but that it’s just fine for rich americans to slay the beasts for their tusks to keep as trophies?"  as josh schwerin from priorities usa action said on twitter: "can anyone think of a reason they would have done this??"

if you want to know the real story, talk to the people roy moore grew up with.  that's what a local newspaper did, and the results were a goldmine.  ask around gadsden, alabama an guess what?  everyone knew!  you didn't know?  you must not be from here.  oh, gosh, where have you been?   one of our favorite stories of the day from al.com:  "these stories have been going around this town for 30 years," said blake usry, who grew up in the area and lives in gadsden. "nobody could believe they hadn't come out yet."  usry, a traveling nurse, said he knew several of the girls that moore tried to flirt with.  "it's not a big secret in this town about roy moore," he said. "that's why it's sort of frustrating to watch" the public disbelieve the women who have come forward, he said."

please pay attention to poland! we sometimes have a hard time caring about events half a world away, but you should watch what’s happening in poland.  yesterday 60,000 protesters jammed the streets of warsaw chanting for a “white europe” or more frighteningly, an “islamic holocaust.”  60,000 white nationalists, neo-nazis and the like from poland and all over europe who want refugees out and their old way of life back.  sound familiar?  the far right is on the rise not only in america but on the continent.  in poland, what began in 2009 as a small protest on the country’s independence day has grown into a frightening annual event that drew its largest crowd ever this year.  the theme of saturday’s march was “we want god,” a phrase that’s not so much as pro-christian as anti-islam, and words that were also spoken by donald trump when he visited poland last summer.  globalization has hit europe too and workers complain they haven’t reaped the benefits of the new economic prosperity.  mix in thousands of migrants from the middle east and africa plus nationalist pride and you have a situation that could be mistaken for something that happened in this neck of the woods 70 years ago.  what a sad irony that poland is the center of this movement, the same country where nearly two two million jews died in concentration camps.  unfortunately fewer and fewer survivors of that tragic time are alive today.  perhaps they would tell us that what starts out small can grow.  it happened in hitler’s germany, and now in 21st century poland.  just two months ago in charlottesville there were around 100 marchers.  in donald trump’s america, where there are “good people on both sides,” will it take off here?   read more on the warsaw march here in the guardian.

donald trump tries to backtrack on comments that he believes vladimir putin, when he says russia didn’t meddle in the election.  reuters reports:  u.s. president donald trump on sunday attempted to clear up confusion over whether he accepts russian president vladimir putin’s denials of meddling in the u.s. election last year.  at a news conference in vietnam, trump distanced himself from remarks he made on saturday in which he suggested he believed putin when he said there had been no russian meddling in the election that took him to the white house.  the comments had drawn criticism at home because u.s. intelligence agencies have long since concluded there was russian meddling.  “as to whether i believe it or not, i’m with our agencies, especially as currently constituted,” trump said at a news conference with vietnamese president tran dai quang.  “as currently led, by fine people, i believe very much in our intelligence agencies.”  he was careful to make clear he sided with the intelligence agencies under his own leadership.  former u.s. intelligence director james clapper had told reuters: “the fact the president of the united states would take putin at his word over that of the intelligence community is quite simply unconscionable.”  the russian issue has clouded trump’s first year in office and his comments on saturday were a distraction from his five-nation asia tour.  trump said he still believed putin did not think there had been russian meddling.  “i believe that president putin really feels, and feels strongly, that he did not meddle in our election,” trump said, while adding: “what he believes is what he believes.”  trump said he was not interested in arguing with putin over meddling and wanted to get on with russia to work on world problems including north korea, syria and ukraine.  trump has called allegations of campaign collusion with moscow a hoax. a special counsel, robert mueller, is conducting an investigation that has led to charges against trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort and his associate rick gates.  u.s. intelligence agencies have also concluded russians interfered to tip the election in trump’s favour through hacking and releasing emails to embarrass democratic candidate hillary clinton and spreading social media propaganda.

take a moment tonight to read this.  it's a really smart take on mental health and mass shootings.  it's written by alexander, a college senior in washington, dc. we are privileged to have so many smart followers and good writers out there!    ___  "reject this. this take, vaguely linking mental illness to mass murder and arguing that americans who are living with a mental health condition are predisposed to violence, is dangerous, stigmatizing, and disheartening. it is especially bad when it’s coming from gun control advocates, popular liberal media figures, and left-wing politicians. 19% of all american adults (≈45 million) currently live with a mental illness, with 10+ million having a “serious” condition. 23% of all american adults use medication to treat a mental condition, and 48% of americans sought treatment for mental health-related issues in 2016. on top of this, 44% of all americans attended counseling last year. 22% of american youth (13-18 years old) will experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people

people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with

bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense

take a moment tonight to read this.  it's a really smart take on mental health and mass shootings.  it's written by alexander, a college senior in washington, dc. we are privileged to have so many smart followers and good writers out there!    ___  "reject this. this take, vaguely linking mental illness to mass murder and arguing that americans who are living with a mental health condition are predisposed to violence, is dangerous, stigmatizing, and disheartening. it is especially bad when it’s coming from gun control advocates, popular liberal media figures, and left-wing politicians. 19% of all american adults (≈45 million) currently live with a mental illness, with 10+ million having a “serious” condition. 23% of all american adults use medication to treat a mental condition, and 48% of americans sought treatment for mental health-related issues in 2016. on top of this, 44% of all americans attended counseling last year. 22% of american youth (13-18 years old) will experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on

illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown, nami, apa, afsp, and so on. you can look up the research/infographics on your own time."

who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown,

take a moment tonight to read this.  it's a really smart take on mental health and mass shootings.  it's written by alexander, a college senior in washington, dc. we are privileged to have so many smart followers and good writers out there!    ___  "reject this. this take, vaguely linking mental illness to mass murder and arguing that americans who are living with a mental health condition are predisposed to violence, is dangerous, stigmatizing, and disheartening. it is especially bad when it’s coming from gun control advocates, popular liberal media figures, and left-wing politicians. 19% of all american adults (≈45 million) currently live with a mental illness, with 10+ million having a “serious” condition. 23% of all american adults use medication to treat a mental condition, and 48% of americans sought treatment for mental health-related issues in 2016. on top of this, 44% of all americans attended counseling last year. 22% of american youth (13-18 years old) will experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016

of americans sought treatment for mental health-related issues in 2016. on top of this, 44% of all americans attended counseling last year. 22% of american youth (13-18 years old) will experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown,

mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown,

take a moment tonight to read this.  it's a really smart take on mental health and mass shootings.  it's written by alexander, a college senior in washington, dc. we are privileged to have so many smart followers and good writers out there!    ___  "reject this. this take, vaguely linking mental illness to mass murder and arguing that americans who are living with a mental health condition are predisposed to violence, is dangerous, stigmatizing, and disheartening. it is especially bad when it’s coming from gun control advocates, popular liberal media figures, and left-wing politicians. 19% of all american adults (≈45 million) currently live with a mental illness, with 10+ million having a “serious” condition. 23% of all american adults use medication to treat a mental condition, and 48% of americans sought treatment for mental health-related issues in 2016. on top of this, 44% of all americans attended counseling last year. 22% of american youth (13-18 years old) will experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church

predisposed to violence, is dangerous, stigmatizing, and disheartening. it is especially bad when it’s coming from gun control advocates, popular liberal media figures, and left-wing politicians. 19% of all american adults (≈45 million) currently live with a mental illness, with 10+ million having a “serious” condition. 23% of all american adults use medication to treat a mental condition, and 48% of americans sought treatment for mental health-related issues in 2016. on top of this, 44% of all americans attended counseling last year. 22% of american youth (13-18 years old) will experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown, nami, apa, afsp, and so on. you can look up the research/infographics on your own time."

in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown,

take a moment tonight to read this.  it's a really smart take on mental health and mass shootings.  it's written by alexander, a college senior in washington, dc. we are privileged to have so many smart followers and good writers out there!    ___  "reject this. this take, vaguely linking mental illness to mass murder and arguing that americans who are living with a mental health condition are predisposed to violence, is dangerous, stigmatizing, and disheartening. it is especially bad when it’s coming from gun control advocates, popular liberal media figures, and left-wing politicians. 19% of all american adults (≈45 million) currently live with a mental illness, with 10+ million having a “serious” condition. 23% of all american adults use medication to treat a mental condition, and 48% of americans sought treatment for mental health-related issues in 2016. on top of this, 44% of all americans attended counseling last year. 22% of american youth (13-18 years old) will experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide

take a moment tonight to read this.  it's a really smart take on mental health and mass shootings.  it's written by alexander, a college senior in washington, dc. we are privileged to have so many smart followers and good writers out there!    ___  "reject this. this take, vaguely linking mental illness to mass murder and arguing that americans who are living with a mental health condition are predisposed to violence, is dangerous, stigmatizing, and disheartening. it is especially bad when it’s coming from gun control advocates, popular liberal media figures, and left-wing politicians. 19% of all american adults (≈45 million) currently live with a mental illness, with 10+ million having a “serious” condition. 23% of all american adults use medication to treat a mental condition, and 48% of americans sought treatment for mental health-related issues in 2016. on top of this, 44% of all americans attended counseling last year. 22% of american youth (13-18 years old) will experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown,

cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown,

smart followers and good writers out there!    ___  "reject this. this take, vaguely linking mental illness to mass murder and arguing that americans who are living with a mental health condition are

of all american adults (≈45 million) currently live with a mental illness, with 10+ million having a “serious” condition. 23% of all american adults use medication to treat a mental condition, and 48%

severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than

claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown,

take a moment tonight to read this.  it's a really smart take on mental health and mass shootings.  it's written by alexander, a college senior in washington, dc. we are privileged to have so many smart followers and good writers out there!    ___  "reject this. this take, vaguely linking mental illness to mass murder and arguing that americans who are living with a mental health condition are predisposed to violence, is dangerous, stigmatizing, and disheartening. it is especially bad when it’s coming from gun control advocates, popular liberal media figures, and left-wing politicians. 19% of all american adults (≈45 million) currently live with a mental illness, with 10+ million having a “serious” condition. 23% of all american adults use medication to treat a mental condition, and 48% of americans sought treatment for mental health-related issues in 2016. on top of this, 44% of all americans attended counseling last year. 22% of american youth (13-18 years old) will experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are

issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown,

everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental

bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense

take a moment tonight to read this.  it's a really smart take on mental health and mass shootings.  it's written by alexander, a college senior in washington, dc. we are privileged to have so many smart followers and good writers out there!    ___  "reject this. this take, vaguely linking mental illness to mass murder and arguing that americans who are living with a mental health condition are predisposed to violence, is dangerous, stigmatizing, and disheartening. it is especially bad when it’s coming from gun control advocates, popular liberal media figures, and left-wing politicians. 19% of all american adults (≈45 million) currently live with a mental illness, with 10+ million having a “serious” condition. 23% of all american adults use medication to treat a mental condition, and 48% of americans sought treatment for mental health-related issues in 2016. on top of this, 44% of all americans attended counseling last year. 22% of american youth (13-18 years old) will experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on

illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown, nami, apa, afsp, and so on. you can look up the research/infographics on your own time."

who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown,

take a moment tonight to read this.  it's a really smart take on mental health and mass shootings.  it's written by alexander, a college senior in washington, dc. we are privileged to have so many smart followers and good writers out there!    ___  "reject this. this take, vaguely linking mental illness to mass murder and arguing that americans who are living with a mental health condition are predisposed to violence, is dangerous, stigmatizing, and disheartening. it is especially bad when it’s coming from gun control advocates, popular liberal media figures, and left-wing politicians. 19% of all american adults (≈45 million) currently live with a mental illness, with 10+ million having a “serious” condition. 23% of all american adults use medication to treat a mental condition, and 48% of americans sought treatment for mental health-related issues in 2016. on top of this, 44% of all americans attended counseling last year. 22% of american youth (13-18 years old) will experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016

of americans sought treatment for mental health-related issues in 2016. on top of this, 44% of all americans attended counseling last year. 22% of american youth (13-18 years old) will experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown,

mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown,

take a moment tonight to read this.  it's a really smart take on mental health and mass shootings.  it's written by alexander, a college senior in washington, dc. we are privileged to have so many smart followers and good writers out there!    ___  "reject this. this take, vaguely linking mental illness to mass murder and arguing that americans who are living with a mental health condition are predisposed to violence, is dangerous, stigmatizing, and disheartening. it is especially bad when it’s coming from gun control advocates, popular liberal media figures, and left-wing politicians. 19% of all american adults (≈45 million) currently live with a mental illness, with 10+ million having a “serious” condition. 23% of all american adults use medication to treat a mental condition, and 48% of americans sought treatment for mental health-related issues in 2016. on top of this, 44% of all americans attended counseling last year. 22% of american youth (13-18 years old) will experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church

predisposed to violence, is dangerous, stigmatizing, and disheartening. it is especially bad when it’s coming from gun control advocates, popular liberal media figures, and left-wing politicians. 19% of all american adults (≈45 million) currently live with a mental illness, with 10+ million having a “serious” condition. 23% of all american adults use medication to treat a mental condition, and 48% of americans sought treatment for mental health-related issues in 2016. on top of this, 44% of all americans attended counseling last year. 22% of american youth (13-18 years old) will experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown, nami, apa, afsp, and so on. you can look up the research/infographics on your own time."

in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown,

take a moment tonight to read this.  it's a really smart take on mental health and mass shootings.  it's written by alexander, a college senior in washington, dc. we are privileged to have so many smart followers and good writers out there!    ___  "reject this. this take, vaguely linking mental illness to mass murder and arguing that americans who are living with a mental health condition are predisposed to violence, is dangerous, stigmatizing, and disheartening. it is especially bad when it’s coming from gun control advocates, popular liberal media figures, and left-wing politicians. 19% of all american adults (≈45 million) currently live with a mental illness, with 10+ million having a “serious” condition. 23% of all american adults use medication to treat a mental condition, and 48% of americans sought treatment for mental health-related issues in 2016. on top of this, 44% of all americans attended counseling last year. 22% of american youth (13-18 years old) will experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide

take a moment tonight to read this.  it's a really smart take on mental health and mass shootings.  it's written by alexander, a college senior in washington, dc. we are privileged to have so many smart followers and good writers out there!    ___  "reject this. this take, vaguely linking mental illness to mass murder and arguing that americans who are living with a mental health condition are predisposed to violence, is dangerous, stigmatizing, and disheartening. it is especially bad when it’s coming from gun control advocates, popular liberal media figures, and left-wing politicians. 19% of all american adults (≈45 million) currently live with a mental illness, with 10+ million having a “serious” condition. 23% of all american adults use medication to treat a mental condition, and 48% of americans sought treatment for mental health-related issues in 2016. on top of this, 44% of all americans attended counseling last year. 22% of american youth (13-18 years old) will experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown,

the folks at morning joe ask our own dan rather to weigh in on the nfl players who take a knee during the national anthem. here's part of what he said:    "i think it's very important we listen to one another when it's peaceful dissent. while it's not my way of kneeling, some stand, some kneel. having respect for those who kneel and even though you say yourself as i say to myself, it's not what i would do, i want to listen to what they have to say. because as i understand what they're saying, it's not disrespect for the country. it's not disrespect certainly for the military. it's about calling attention to injustice."  watch for more.

donald trump nominates jerome powell to lead the federal reserve. he's a republican, but was appointed by former president barack obama to his current job five years ago. many believe he will easily be confirmed.  reuters has more:  president donald trump on thursday tapped fed governor jerome powell to become head of the u.s. central bank, promoting a soft-spoken centrist to replace janet yellen when her term expires in february 2018.  powell, appointed to the fed board in 2012 by then-president barack obama, emerged as trump’s choice from a five-person slate of possible nominees that included yellen as well as others who would have represented a sharp change in monetary policy.  in an announcement at the white house, trump called powell a strong, committed and smart leader.  “he has proved to be a consensus builder for the sound monetary and financial policy that he believes in ... based on his record i am confident that jay has the wisdom and leadership to guide our economy,” trump said as the fed nominee looked on.  the decision, which ended an unusually public, months-long search, offers a bit of both worlds, allowing trump to select a new fed chief while getting continuity with a yellen-run central bank that has kept the economy and markets on an even keel.  powell, a 64-year-old lawyer and former investment banker, has backed yellen’s general direction on monetary policy and, in recent years, shared her concerns that weak inflation justified a continued cautious approach to raising interest rates.  in june, he laid out both a defense of the fed’s gradualist path and a critique of those, including some of his competitors for the fed’s top job, who argued that the central bank had increased the risk of high inflation and other problems.  trump on several occasions has said he would prefer rates to stay low, a position at odds with some of those who were on his short list for the fed job, particularly stanford university economist john taylor and former fed governor kevin warsh. top white house economic adviser gary cohn also was a contender.  praises fed patience  powell has been a reliable supporter of the consensus forged by yellen on the policy-setting federal open market committee, and likely will be seen as a less risky choice with the economy growing solidly and u.s. stock markets near record highs.  the fed has raised rates twice this year and is widely expected to do so again next month.  ”the (fomc) has been patient in raising rates, and that patience has paid dividends,“ powell said in his remarks to the economic club of new york in june.”  “after a tumultuous decade, the economy is now close to full employment and price stability. the problems that some commentators predicted have not come to pass. accommodative policy did not generate high inflation or excessive credit growth.”  but powell has gone further than his colleagues in calling to relax some of the stricter regulations imposed after the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession, also one of trump’s goals. powell can now pursue that end along with trump appointee randal quarles, the fed’s new vice chair for supervision.  though he will be the first fed chief since the late 1970s without an advanced degree in economics, powell brings market insights, fed board experience and ties to the republican party that analysts argued likely make for a smooth transition and relatively easy senate confirmation.  under president george h.w. bush, powell oversaw policy on financial institutions and debt markets as an undersecretary of the treasury. from 1997 to 2005 he was a partner at the carlyle group, a private equity firm, and focused on public debt dynamics while at the bipartisan policy center think tank.  “the kernel of what this boiled down to is that in selecting powell, (trump) has all but selected yellen,” said sarah binder, a political science professor at george washington university and author of a recent book on fed politics. “there is not really much daylight, if any.”  yellen is entitled to remain as a fed governor until 2024, though previous central bank chiefs have traditionally not stayed once a successor was in place.

we now know a lot more about donald trump's tax plan. a couple of the most controversial parts involve limiting the deduction of mortgage interest for newly purchased homes and rolling back some of the local and state tax deductions.   here are details from reuters:  president donald trump’s drive for the deep tax cuts that he promised as a candidate reached a major milestone on thursday, with his fellow republicans in the house of representatives unveiling long-awaited legislation to overhaul the tax code.  the legislation called for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and reducing the number of tax brackets for individuals, according to a summary document obtained by reuters.  largely in line with expectations for the tax-cut plan they have been developing behind closed doors for weeks, the house tax-writing ways and means committee proposed doubling the standard deduction for individuals and families, capping the deduction for state and local property taxes at $10,000 and maintaining the current tax treatment of 401(k) and ira retirement plans.  the bill is the starting gun for a frantic race toward what trump and republicans in the house and senate hope will be their first major legislative victory since he took office in january: the enactment this year of a package with up to $6 trillion in tax cuts over the next decade for corporations, small businesses and individuals.  the bill would create new a family tax credit, maintain deductions for mortgage interest for existing loans and newly purchased homes up to $500,000, double exemptions for estate taxes on inherited assets, repeal estate taxes after six years and allow small businesses to write off loan interest, according to the document.  congress has not succeeded on comprehensive tax changes since 1986, when republican ronald reagan was in the white house and democrats controlled the house. bipartisan cooperation led to the passage of that plan three decades ago, but republicans have frozen democrats out of the process of developing this legislation and passed a budget plan that would enable them to pass it with no democratic votes.  independent analysts have said that, based on an outline of the plan previously made public, corporations and the wealthiest americans would benefit the most, and the federal deficit would be greatly expanded over the next decade because of a loss of tax revenue.  trump said at the white house this week that he wanted congress to pass the tax overhaul by the u.s. thanksgiving holiday on nov. 23.  the tax-writing house ways and means committee has been drafting the bill, and republican chairman kevin brady has promised to release it on thursday. a spokesman for republican house speaker paul ryan said it would be formally announced at 11:15 a.m. (1515 gmt).  trump, house republican leaders and republican members of brady’s panel will then meet at the white house on thursday afternoon. trump is also meeting separately with republican senators, who must also unite to pass the tax plan.  “this is the beginning of the end of this horrible tax code,” brady told reporters on thursday as he entered a meeting with republican lawmakers ahead of the bill’s release.  “we’re going to get it done,” added house republican leader kevin mccarthy.  still, important issues remain unresolved and brady himself predicts the initial legislation will change next week, when his panel is due to begin preparing it for an eventual house vote.  while republicans control the white house and both chambers of congress, intra-party differences have prevented them from passing major legislation sought by trump, as exemplified by the collapse of their effort to dismantle the obamacare law. any failure to pass tax cuts legislation would call into question republicans’ basic ability to deliver on promises.  the bill must also pass the senate, where republicans hold a slimmer 52-48 majority and earlier this year failed to garner enough votes to pass a major healthcare overhaul. senate republican leaders have said they aim to finish their work on taxes by year-end.  democrats have criticized the proposed tax cuts as a giveaway to corporations and the wealthy that would harm workers and middle-class americans.

new york governor andrew cuomo reacts to donald trump's tweets about the ny terror attack saying:  "the president's tweets i think were not helpful, i do not think they were factual. i think they tended to point fingers and politicize the situation."  these were trump's tweets that cuomo was referring to:  "i have just ordered homeland security to step up our already extreme vetting program. being politically correct is fine, but not for this!"  "the terrorist came into our country through what is called the "diversity visa lottery program," a chuck schumer beauty. i want merit based."  "we are fighting hard for merit based immigration, no more democrat lottery systems. we must get much tougher (and smarter).  @foxandfriends"  see what else governor cuomo had to say.

for all those celebrating the actions of the special counsel, take note; this is a very dangerous time for our country.  we are one “firing” away from a constitutional crisis. if robert mueller goes, all bets are off.   you have a president divorced from reality, a massive propaganda machine in fox news brainwashing millions of americans daily and a congress that has the spine of a worm.  from vox:  “the fate of the investigation — and of the integrity of the american political process — will thus rest on the often frail shoulders of the handful of congressional republicans who’ve made it clear that they understand the threat trump poses to the country but have never yet managed to conduct effective, coordinated political action to counter the threat. if they want to forestall disaster, that needs to change. and it needs to happen fast, before trump plunges us into a new round of crisis.”

it’s come to this. nine months into donald trump’s term, a major news organization has produced an ad aimed at the president and his lies. and the fact that cnn feels it needs to fight back says volumes. trump’s strategy is working. blaming the press for all his problems, saying facts are fake, raging against the media for making up stories—which are true—is unfortunately resonating in parts of our country. it’s a clever ad, but a sad day for america.

to not be outraged would be to normalize this president.  we’ve said it before and it needs to be repeated, as sure as the sun rises in the east, donald trump is going to lie.  and he did it again yesterday in spades. the occasion was a news conference with his new best friend-longtime enemy mitch mcconnell.  axios mike allen breaks down trump’s alternative reality.   —  •trump says he and mcconnell are "closer than ever before." both men and their staffs have been trashing each other in public and private for months.  •trump says other presidents "didn't make calls" to families of soldiers killed in duty. they did.  •trump says obamacare is "dead." his repeated efforts to repeal it failed.  •trump says it's been established that "no collusion" took place with the russians. bob mueller is interrogating the president's associates and advisers on this very point in real time.  •trump says he "already" has "the votes right now" for a bipartisan health care fix. he doesn't.  sound smart: the damnedest thing is that not a single bullet point i just wrote is disputable. while every one of those things the president said was.  why it matters: it's almost impossible for the media to cover these press conferences — or for republicans to discern what he wants and how he plans to get it — because trump spreads fake news while calling real news fake. this isn't new. and, yes, 35% of voters don't seem to care. but that doesn't make it any less dangerous.  yesterday's keepers:  •on gop senators: "i'm not going to blame myself, i'll be honest. they are not getting the job done."  •"obamacare is finished. it's dead. it's gone. it's no longer — you shouldn't even mention. it's gone. there is no such thing as obamacare anymore."  •on steve bannon's war on mcconnell and the republican establishment: "steve is ... a friend of mine ... i can understand where steve bannon is coming from. ... i know how he feels. ... there are some republicans, frankly, that should be ashamed of themselves."  •on whether he's considering firing mueller: "no, not at all."  •"oh, i hope hillary runs. is she going to run? i hope. hillary, please run again."  -p.s. bannon tells me by email: "mcconnell and the gop establishment have sown the wind — now be prepared the reap the whirlwind."

jimmy kimmel, a las vegas native, could barely get through his monologue last night as he addressed the massacre in his hometown. he also directed part of his remarks at the politicians who continuously vote to make gun laws more relaxed.  "with all due respect, your thoughts and your prayers are insufficient. and by the way, the house of representatives will be voting on a piece of legislation this week. it's a bill to legalize the sale of silencers for guns. this is what they're working on. we have a major problem with gun violence in this country and i guess they don't care. if i'm wrong on that, fine, do something about it because i'm sick of it. and you know, i want this to be a comedy show. i hate talking about stuff like this. i just want to laugh about things every night, but that -- it seems to becoming increasingly difficult lately. it feels like someone has opened a window into hell. and what i'm talking about tonight isn't about gun control. it's about common sense. common sense says no good will ever come from allowing a person to have weapons that can take down 527 americans at a concert."

donald trump took to twitter today to bash the mayor of san juan, carmen yulin cruz. this comes after she begged the president for more help. here's what trump said:  "the mayor of san juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the democrats that you must be nasty to trump. ...such poor leadership ability by the mayor of san juan, and others in puerto rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. they.......want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 federal workers now on island doing a fantastic job. the military and first responders, despite no electric, roads, phones etc., have done an amazing job. puerto rico was totally destroyed."  soon after trump made those statements, cruz tweeted "the goal is one: saving lives. this is the time to show our "true colors". we cannot be distracted by anything else."  nate silver from fivethirtyeight has a couple theories as to why trump is attacking cruz. he says:  “so, it totally fits the pattern that trump is attacking the mayor san juan. she challenged him and she's a woman (and hispanic, obviously.)"  “alternative hypothesis: trump has poor impulse control & is easily triggered, especially when being challenged (esp. by women & minorities).”  as for trump suggesting "they want everything to be done for them"...that again suggests puerto rico either isn't part of the us or is a welfare state. as the mayor said last night, in this interview on cnn, the community is doing everything they can possibly do and the mayor is doing this while sleeping in a shelter herself (her own home was destroyed). the citizens are desperate though for things like food, water and medicine...aid they desperately need from the us.

donald trump turned a campaign rally for alabama senate candidate luther strange into a sales pitch for the wall along the mexican border. a wall he says, "we're spending a tremendous amount of money" on. trump told the crowd:  "the wall is happening. in fact, you probably saw, you know, we have a wall up there now, and we are renovating it already. it's being made pristine, perfect, just as good as new, though we may go a little higher than that, but that's okay. and we are building samples of a new wall. you know, it has to be a see-through wall."  here's more of why trump says he wants the wall to be see-through.
your morning metaphor is brought to you by the washington post. where, oh where is donald trump? portraits of the president are customarily hung in federal buildings across the country, but the normally camera-loving trump is nowhere to be seen, 9 months after inauguration.   "the missing pictures might seem to be a minor matter in an administration consumed with hurricane relief, the north korean nuclear threat, an investigation into trump campaign contacts with russians, illegal immigration and other issues. �"yet to some, the absence of the ubiquitous official photos is puzzling, considering the chief executive’s fame was propelled by reality television and he has never been reluctant to promote his image. some agencies have been so determined to show the president’s photograph that they’ve improvised, downloading a scowling — and some say unflattering — photo of trump posted on the white house website."

ivanka trump's presence at a key meeting yesterday seems like it didn't sit well with lawmakers.  the new york times reports:  "mr. trump often invites his daughter ivanka trump into meetings to signal their conclusion — or to keep his interlocutors off balance. when ms. trump entered the office toward the end of the discussion on wednesday, ostensibly to discuss tax reform, republicans in the room reacted with astonishment and annoyance.  mr. mcconnell, who is barely on speaking terms with the president, quietly seethed, according to two people familiar with the situation."  the week has more.

former president barack obama has largely avoided criticizing donald trump since he took over the oval office. that could change if trump ends daca tomorrow, as expected.  politico reports:  obama’s current plan is to post a statement on facebook and link to it on twitter, where the former president has more than 94 million followers. in his final presidential press availability, he suggested that he would speak out if trump went after the dreamers — and that it was one of the few issues where he would feel morally compelled to do so. he said he would not remain silent in the face of “efforts to round up kids who have grown up here and for all practical purposes are american kids, and send them someplace else, when they love this country.”

"what you've seen on the television screen, hour after hour, are examples of duty, honor, bravery. police officer perez trying to get to work, drowned. this has been, i think, the optics out of houston with the mayor, mayor turner, and the police chief acevedo, has been about that duty, honor, bravery.  when president trump came (to texas), the question is whether he could pick up on that, communicate that in some way.   now, i'm not here to judge whether he did or didn't. each person will have to judge for themselves, but i think there's a very serious case to be made that although the president went, give him credit for that, didn't make any big mistakes, but he sort of came and went and ran the risk of seeming irrelevant. this is part of the problem he's having with his presidency, whether he is all show and no go. or as they would say in texas, all hat and no cattle, because he can't deliver."  -dan rather on msnbc with chris hayes  -august 30, 2017

the remaining members of the president's commission on arts and humanities have resigned in protest over donald trump's comments on charlottesville.   from the washington post:  "members of the president’s committee are drawn from broadway, hollywood, and the broader arts and entertainment community and said in a letter to trump that “your words and actions push us all further away from the freedoms we are guaranteed.”  “reproach and censure in the strongest possible terms are necessary following your support of the hate groups and terrorists who killed and injured fellow americans in charlottesville,” the commissioners wrote in a letter sent to the white house on friday morning. “the false equivalencies you push cannot stand. the administration’s refusal to quickly and unequivocally condemn the cancer of hatred only further emboldens those who wish america ill. we cannot sit idly by, the way that your west wing advisors have, without speaking out against your words and actions.”

here's a look at some of president trump's stunning news conference today:  "what about the alt left that came charging at, as you say, at the alt right? do they have any a semblance of guilt? what about the fact that they came charging with clubs in their hands swinging clubs? do they have any problem? i think they do. that was a horrible, horrible day. wait a minute. i'm not finished. i'm not finished, fake news."   "you had a group on one side that was bad. you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. and nobody wants to say that. i'll say it right now. you had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit and they were very, very violent."  "not all of those people were neo-nazis, believe me. not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch. those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue, robert e. lee."
in a bizarre and contentious news conference, the president compared the alt-right to what he now calls the "alt-left" (meaning protestors on the other side). when reporters challenged him on it, he said the alt-left should be partially blamed  for what happened in charlottesville, but said "nobody wants to say that."  trump went on to say some people protesting the removal of the robert e. lee statue were peaceful and had a permit, but the other side didn't have a permit.  clips coming...

heather heyer, the 32-year-old who was killed in charlottesville, died standing up for a cause she believed in. that's according to her friend and former co-worker marissa blair. today blair told cnn's chris cuomo:  "if you knew heather, you would know she loves everyone and wants equality for everyone, no matter who you love, what color you are. she was very strong in what she felt and she spoke with conviction. she would never back down from what she believed in. that's what she died doing, fighting for what she believed in."
virginia governor terry mcauliffe delivers a strong message many say should have come from the president. mcauliffe addressed the nation, condemning specific racist groups. here's part of what he said:   "i have a message to all the white supremacists and the nazis who came into charlottesville today. our message is plain and simple. go home. you are not wanted in this great commonwealth. shame on you. you pretend that you're patriots, but you are anything but a patriot."   "you came here today to hurt people, and you did hurt people. but my message is clear, we are stronger than you. you have made our commonwealth stronger. you will not succeed. there is no place for you here, there is no place for you in america."   #charlottesville

the president has been criticized for not coming out and specifically condemning white supremacists for the violence over the last 24 hours in virginia. in case there is any question as to why this is important, new york times contributing writer anushay hossain, a uva alum, put it this way on cnn:   "i want to hear specifics from this president. the statement that he released...we could apply that to a situation anywhere. why isn't coming out against hate groups, against the klan? these are not just regular protesters, they are klan members without their hoods. why isn't he speaking about neofascism, neo-nazism?"  "we need a clear statement from our president that this kind of violence will not be tolerated, not for everyone. this is white supremacy, supremacists out in full force."

more now from donald trump's q&a with reporters today. the president gave a rather flippant response when asked about vladimir putin's order to cut the number of us diplomats working in russia by as many as 755 people. trump said he was thankful that hundreds of people were losing their jobs:  "i want to thank him because we're trying to cut down on payroll and as far as i'm concerned i'm very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll. there's no real reason for them to go back, so i -- i greatly appreciate the fact that they have been able to cut our payroll for the united states. we'll save a lot of money."

here's the video of tillerson making his remarks.  tillerson is also defending the president's controversial comments about "fire and fury" against north korea telling reporters:  "i think what the president was doing is sending a strong message that kim jong un will understand. i think the president wanted to be clear to the north korean regime that the us has an unconditional ability to defend itself, will defend itself and its allies."

how many of your tax dollars are going into donald trump's pocket? that's what democrats want to find out. how much does the government spend at trump's for-profit properties? amazingly, the answer appears to be no one knows.  from cnbc:  "most presidents have maintained and visited their personal homes while in office. think george w. bush's crawford, texas, ranch and barack obama's chicago house.  "the difference with trump is that his residences are part of his business empire. that means when the state department and department of homeland security spend money to move and protect the president around his own properties, some taxpayer money makes its way into trump organization coffers."

dow jones tops 22,000 for the first time and guess who's taking credit?    but donald trump sang a different tune before the election.  from the washington post:  "the problem is that before he was elected, he warned repeatedly that the stock market would crash as soon as the federal reserve began raising interest rates. in the aftermath of the great recession, the fed dramatically lowered rates to near zero — and kept them there for years. as he began running for president, trump darkly warned that rates were being kept artificially low to ensure hillary clinton’s election and that everything would tumble once rates began to creep up again.  "the fed did begin to raise rates — on dec. 17, 2015, dec. 15, 2016, march 16, 2017, and june 15, 2017. and yet the market has not plunged as trump predicted, but has continued to climb."

maybe john kelly should wait to order new furniture. as donald trump welcomes a new chief of staff to the white house (not to mention new press secretary, new director of communications, and someday soon new attorney general) it's best to remember the president's white house dress code--always wear something that would look good under a bus.  what industry leader or bright young talent would ever subject themselves to this workplace torture?  instead we get guys nicknamed "the mooch" who give us anatomy lessons.    ezra klein at vox once again hits the nail on the head.   "for trump, though, loyalty is a one-way street. he turns out to be precisely one of those guys who will stab a friend in the back as soon as the friend becomes a problem. and the problem for trump, and for the rest of us, is that the whole country is watching him do it."

ah, the incredible shrinking airline seat. it's difficult to measure one's posterior, but if it was uncomfortably tight the last time you squeezed into economy, you're probably more than 17 inches across, cheek to cheek. that's the absurdly narrow width of many airline seats today.  and don't get us started on legroom.  31 inches is great if you have a plane full of 8-year-olds.  but as passengers grow larger and seats shrink, are cramped cabins a safety issue?  a federal appeals court rules yes. via bloomberg.

reince priebus entered the history books as the shortest serving (non-interim) chief-of-staff in history (189 days). from the outside, it seems like his final days or weeks on the job were rather rocky. that said, priebus sure doesn't seem to have any hard feelings about his departure from the white house. here's part of an interview he did with cnn's wolf blitzer...  priebus: i'm always going to be a trump fan. i'm on team trump, and i look forward to helping him achieve his goals and his agenda for the american people.   blitzer: but why did you resign? i'm still trying to understand. i understand that you told the president you wanted to resign. he accepted your resignation yesterday. but why? were there a series of issues? was there one thing that came up and you decided, you know what, i no longer can do this?   priebus: look, i think the president wanted to go a different direction. i support him in that.
