today, attorney general jeff sessions officially announced that $12 million in grants and funding will be provided to help law enforcement tackle certain parts of the opioid crisis, particularly the production and trafficking of the drug on local levels.   there were more drug-related deaths in 2016 than the entire vietnam war and car crashes, gun violence, and hiv/aids ever did in a single year (according to vox). the president declared the opioid problem a “public health emergency” in october of 2017, in contrast to a national emergency, which would have made funds for treatment, prescription monitoring etc. more rapidly available. instead, there has been no substantial funding allocated to combating the issue until this measly attempt.    experts say it will take over $183 billion over ten years to combat this crisis. providing $12 million to this multi-billion dollar problem is like tossing a glass of water on a forest fire. even with the $1 billion drug treatment bill, this crisis is severely underfunded. if this doesn't get sorted out soon, our ability to get this epidemic under control will go up in flames.

a rather strange situation is unfolding at the consumer financial protection bureau. bizarre to us, but just another day in trumpland. it started last week when cfpb director richard cordray (an obama appointee) stepped down and named leandra english deputy director of the agency. the agency's official website posted the news along with this statement from cordray, "leandra is a seasoned professional who has spent her career of public service focused on promoting smooth and efficient operations." soon after though donald trump decided to make his own appointment naming budget director mick mulvaney as the interim head of the agency. this has caused quite the uproar, with democrats like chuck schumer saying:  "the process for succession laid out in dodd frank is clear: leandra english, not mick mulvaney, is the acting dir of @cfpb. by attempting to install mr. mulvaney as director, the trump admin is ignoring the established, legal order of succession that we purposefully put in place."  how mulvaney has time to lead the budget office and the cfpb is beyond us, but now we are learning the battle over who will temporary lead the cfpb is going to head to court.   the hill reports:  the deputy director of the consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb), leandra english, is suing president trump in order to block office of management and budget director mick mulvaney from taking over as acting director of the agency.  english filed a complaint sunday night against trump and mulvaney, whom the president nominated to be cfpb's interim leader.  english claims that she is the rightful acting director of the cfpb...

breaking from representative john conyers. amid sexual harassment allegations, the democrat released this statement today:  after careful consideration and in light of the attention drawn by recent allegations made against me, i have notified the democratic leader of my request to step aside as ranking member of the house judiciary committee during the investigation of these matters.  i deny these allegations, many of which were raised by documents reportedly paid for by a partisan alt-right blogger. i very much look forward to vindicating myself and my family before the house committee on ethics.  to be clear, i would like very much to remain as ranking member. there is still much work to be done on core concerns like securing civil rights, enacting meaningful criminal justice reform, and protecting access to the ballot box.  these challenges could not be more pressing in the face of an administration that cares little for the rule of law and a president whose actions and conduct cheapens our discourse every day.  but i have come to believe that my presence as ranking member on the committee would not serve these efforts while the ethics committee investigation is pending.  i cannot in good conscience allow these charges to undermine my colleagues in the democratic caucus, and my friends on both sides of the aisle in the judiciary committee and the house of representatives.  i am proud and fortunate to be part of a legacy of more than 50 years of fighting for civil rights and making our country more equitable and just.  i’ll never allow that legacy – a legacy i owe to my father  john conyers, sr., who integrated labor unions, or my two amazing sons john iii & carl and my loving wife monica, and the extraordinary people of detroit – to be cast aside, or these causes to be in any way diminished.  i am grateful to my colleagues who have called for due process before weighing judgment. i would urge them to continue to do so for any member accused of wrongdoing. basic fairness requires no less.

here’s another piece of gop handiwork you need to know about.  the healthcare of nine million children is being held hostage by republicans in the house. nine million kids who depend on the chips program as well as more than 300,000 pregnant women are about to be without coverage. the denver post reports, chips  programs nationwide are about the begin closing because congress refuses to act.   “most chip families, who earn too much for medicaid but too little to afford private insurance, are not aware lawmakers’ inaction is endangering coverage. they’re about to find out, though. virginia and several other states are preparing letters to go out as early as monday warning families their children’s insurance may be taken away.”
if you think the russian hackers were just some rogue group out for a sunday troll, check out this investigation by the associated press:  “the hackers who disrupted the u.s. presidential election last year had ambitions that stretched across the globe, targeting the emails of ukrainian officers, russian opposition figures, u.s. defense contractors and thousands of others of interest to the kremlin, according to a previously unpublished digital hit list obtained by the associated press.”
there is no doubt that jared kushner’s role seems to have diminished.  washington post reports:  following recent reports, which the white house denied, that the president privately blames kushner for special counsel robert s. mueller iii’s widening probe, ­breitbart, the conservative website, snarkily dubbed him “mr. perfect.” the nickname originated from promotional material kushner’s own family used, when trying to lure chinese investors to their new jersey real estate projects.  some aides scoff at the notion that kushner isn’t still whispering to the president about official business. but one of kelly’s conditions for taking the job was that everyone, including kushner and his wife, had to go through him to reach the president, and kelly has made clear that kushner reports to him, aides said.
his legislative accomplishments wouldn’t fill a teacup but pay attention, dear friends, because donald trump is quietly remaking one branch of government.  the federal judiciary is being stuffed with like minds of donald trump.  we’ve brought you the story of brett talley, the gop blogger who was nominated to the bench without so much as one day of trial experience.  now comes jeff mateer, who according to slate "has called transgender children part of “satan’s plan,” dismissed same-sex marriage as “debauchery,” and asserted that the constitutional separation of church and state is a myth."  but talley and mateer are just the beginning.  right-leaning lawyers are suddenly taking advantage of an opening, and the federalist society is example a.  before last year’s election, this group of prominent conservatives decried the possibility of a trump presidency in a now infamous statement:  "trump’s long record of statements and conduct, in his campaign and in his business career, have shown him indifferent or hostile to the constitution’s basic features—including a government of limited powers, an independent judiciary, religious liberty, freedom of speech, and due process of law."  one year later, with trump floundering and the congress suddenly in play in 2018, the federalists are now demanding that the judiciary be expanded, quickly.  congress, they argue, should allocate more money for more courts.  what they don't say is those courts would be packed with conservative jurists for years to come as slate.com writer dahlia lithwick so eloquently explains.

important:  this story is from a few days ago but you need to know the tax bill, with the "personhood" language, passed out of committee last night and is on its way to the senate floor.  the measure would allow, by law, an unborn child to be the beneficiary of a college savings account, thereby giving rights to the unborn which would then make it a crime to abort them.  sneaky.  from huffpost:  "it’s already relatively easy, under current tax law, to open a 529 before a child is born. the real intention here is to sneak anti-abortion language into federal law, according to feminists and abortion rights advocates.  the tax bill’s language is part of a broader strategy employed by the white house and congressional republicans to chip away at roe v. wade, says sarah lipton-lubet, vice president for reproductive health and rights at the national partnership for women and families. for years, anti-abortion activists have tried (and mostly failed) to get “personhood” laws passed that would give embryos and fetuses rights ― ultimately making it a crime to abort them."

senator bob menendez thanks a new jersey jury after his corruption case ends with a deadlock.   reuters reports:  the corruption trial of democratic u.s. senator bob menendez ended in a mistrial on thursday, after the jury said it was hopelessly deadlocked on bribery, fraud and other charges, according to multiple news reporters in the courtroom.  menendez, 63, a longtime fixture in new jersey political circles who first joined the senate in 2006, was accused of accepting private flights, campaign contributions and other bribes from a wealthy patron, florida ophthalmologist salomon melgen, in exchange for official favors.  the jury deliberated for most of last week before restarting their discussions on monday after one juror had to be replaced due to a scheduling conflict. jurors first indicated they were having trouble reaching a verdict on monday.  “i find you are unable to reach a verdict and that further deliberations would be futile, and that there is no alternative but to declare a mistrial,” u.s. judge williams walls told jurors on thursday, according to a twitter post from a philadelphia inquirer reporter.  the hung jury is a major setback for federal prosecutors in what was their first high-profile corruption trial since a u.s. supreme court decision last year limited their ability to bring such cases.  the justice department can still pursue a second trial, though it was not immediately clear whether prosecutors would choose to do so.  defense attorneys argued that prosecutors had cherry-picked gifts exchanged between close friends in an effort to suggest impropriety when none existed.  the verdict provides at least temporary relief for menendez’s democratic colleagues in the senate. had menendez been convicted, republicans would likely have pushed for either resignation or expulsion, giving republican new jersey governor chris christie a chance to replace him and extend the republicans’ current 52-48 edge.

conservationists and animal groups are reacting to an abc news report that says, "the trump administration plans to allow hunters to import trophies of elephants they killed in zimbabwe and zambia back to the united states, reversing a ban put in place by the obama administration in 2014, a u.s. fish and wildlife service official confirmed to abc news today."  the humane society of the united states issued a statement saying:  "let’s be clear: elephants are on the list of threatened species; the global community has rallied to stem the ivory trade; and now, the u.s. government is giving american trophy hunters the green light to kill them.  what kind of message does it send to say to the world that poor africans who are struggling to survive cannot kill elephants in order to use or sell their parts to make a living, but that it’s just fine for rich americans to slay the beasts for their tusks to keep as trophies?"  as josh schwerin from priorities usa action said on twitter: "can anyone think of a reason they would have done this??"

update: hundreds are dead, thousands injured and scores left homeless, after a large earthquake hits iran and iraq.
the death toll is rising after an earthquake hits iraq and iran.   reuters reports:  more than 120 people were killed in iran and at least several others in iraq on sunday when a powerful magnitude 7.3 earthquake hit the region, state media in the two countries said, as rescuers stepped up efforts overnight to find dozens trapped under rubble.  at least 129 people were killed in iran’s kermanshah province on the iraqi border, the provincial deputy governor told state television.  “there are still people under the rubble. we hope the number of dead and injured won’t rise too much, but it will rise,” mojtaba nikkerdar said  more than 60 of the victims were in the town of sarpol-e zahab, about 15 km (10 miles) from the border.  kurdish health officials also said at least four people were killed in iraq and there were 50 injured.  the u.s. geological survey said the quake measured magnitude 7.3, while an iraqi meteorology official put its magnitude at 6.5 with the epicentre in penjwin in sulaimaniyah province in the kurdistan region close to the main border crossing with iran.  the electricity was cut off in several iranian and iraqi cities, and fears of aftershocks sent thousands of people in both countries out onto the streets and parks in cold weather.  “the night has made it difficult for helicopters to fly to the affected areas and some roads are also cut off... we are worried about remote villages,” iranian interior minister abdolreza rahmani fazli said in an interview on state television.  many houses in rural parts of the province are made of mud bricks and are known to crumble easily in quake-prone iran.  a quake registering a magnitude between 7 and 7.9 can inflict widespread, heavy damage.  local people said in media reports and on twitter they had felt several aftershocks. television said schools were closed in kermanshah and ilam provinces on monday.  iraq  on the iraqi side, the most extensive damage was in the town of darbandikhan, 75 km (47 miles) east of the city of sulaimaniyah in the semi-autonomous kurdistan region.  more than 30 people were injured in the town, according to kurdish health minister rekawt hama rasheed.  “the situation there is very critical,” rasheed told reuters.  the district’s main hospital was severely damaged and had no power, rasheed said, so the injured were being taken to sulaimaniyah for treatment. there was extensive structural damage to buildings and homes.  in halabja, local officials said a 12-year-old boy died from an electric shock when an electric cable fell during the earthquake.  many residents in the iraqi capital, baghdad, rushed out of houses and tall buildings in panic.  “i was sitting with my kids having dinner and suddenly the building was just dancing in the air,” said majida ameer, who ran out of her building in the capital’s salihiya district with her three children. “i thought at first that it was a huge bomb. but then i heard everyone around me screaming: ‘earthquake!'”  there were similar scenes in erbil, the capital of the kurdistan region, and across other cities in northern iraq, close to the quake’s epicentre.  iraq’s meteorology centre advised people to stay away from buildings and not to use elevators, in case of aftershocks.  turkey  residents of turkey’s southeastern city of diyarbakir also reported feeling a strong tremor, but there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties in the city.  turkish red crescent chairman kerem kinik told broadcaster ntv that red crescent teams in erbil were preparing to go to the site of the earthquake, and that turkey’s national disaster management agency, afad, and national medical rescue teams (umke) were also preparing to head into iraq. afad’s chairman said the organisation was waiting for a reply to its offer for help.  in a tweet, kinik said the turkish red crescent was gathering 3,000 tents and heaters, 10,000 beds and blankets and moving them towards the iraqi border.  “we are coordinating with iranian and iraqi red crescent groups. we are also getting prepared to make deliveries from our northern iraq erbil depot,” he said.  israeli media said the quake was felt in many parts of israel too.
please pay attention to poland! we sometimes have a hard time caring about events half a world away, but you should watch what’s happening in poland.  yesterday 60,000 protesters jammed the streets of warsaw chanting for a “white europe” or more frighteningly, an “islamic holocaust.”  60,000 white nationalists, neo-nazis and the like from poland and all over europe who want refugees out and their old way of life back.  sound familiar?  the far right is on the rise not only in america but on the continent.  in poland, what began in 2009 as a small protest on the country’s independence day has grown into a frightening annual event that drew its largest crowd ever this year.  the theme of saturday’s march was “we want god,” a phrase that’s not so much as pro-christian as anti-islam, and words that were also spoken by donald trump when he visited poland last summer.  globalization has hit europe too and workers complain they haven’t reaped the benefits of the new economic prosperity.  mix in thousands of migrants from the middle east and africa plus nationalist pride and you have a situation that could be mistaken for something that happened in this neck of the woods 70 years ago.  what a sad irony that poland is the center of this movement, the same country where nearly two two million jews died in concentration camps.  unfortunately fewer and fewer survivors of that tragic time are alive today.  perhaps they would tell us that what starts out small can grow.  it happened in hitler’s germany, and now in 21st century poland.  just two months ago in charlottesville there were around 100 marchers.  in donald trump’s america, where there are “good people on both sides,” will it take off here?   read more on the warsaw march here in the guardian.
donald trump tries to backtrack on comments that he believes vladimir putin, when he says russia didn’t meddle in the election.  reuters reports:  u.s. president donald trump on sunday attempted to clear up confusion over whether he accepts russian president vladimir putin’s denials of meddling in the u.s. election last year.  at a news conference in vietnam, trump distanced himself from remarks he made on saturday in which he suggested he believed putin when he said there had been no russian meddling in the election that took him to the white house.  the comments had drawn criticism at home because u.s. intelligence agencies have long since concluded there was russian meddling.  “as to whether i believe it or not, i’m with our agencies, especially as currently constituted,” trump said at a news conference with vietnamese president tran dai quang.  “as currently led, by fine people, i believe very much in our intelligence agencies.”  he was careful to make clear he sided with the intelligence agencies under his own leadership.  former u.s. intelligence director james clapper had told reuters: “the fact the president of the united states would take putin at his word over that of the intelligence community is quite simply unconscionable.”  the russian issue has clouded trump’s first year in office and his comments on saturday were a distraction from his five-nation asia tour.  trump said he still believed putin did not think there had been russian meddling.  “i believe that president putin really feels, and feels strongly, that he did not meddle in our election,” trump said, while adding: “what he believes is what he believes.”  trump said he was not interested in arguing with putin over meddling and wanted to get on with russia to work on world problems including north korea, syria and ukraine.  trump has called allegations of campaign collusion with moscow a hoax. a special counsel, robert mueller, is conducting an investigation that has led to charges against trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort and his associate rick gates.  u.s. intelligence agencies have also concluded russians interfered to tip the election in trump’s favour through hacking and releasing emails to embarrass democratic candidate hillary clinton and spreading social media propaganda.

it’s the morning after the election, and it’s mourning time for the gop.  for those republicans living in donald trump’s fantasyland, heads up. his coattails are on fire.  you want to run in 2018 on the trump agenda?  voters in new jersey and virginia said no thanks, or more likely something not printable here.  republican ed gillespie lost to democrat ralph northam in the virginia governors race despite distancing his gop campaign from the white house.  can you imagine how bad it would have been if trump campaigned in virginia?  and it wasn't just the governorship.  in what the richmond-times dispatch called the "tsunami election," democrats erased a  32-seat gop advantage in the virginia legislature.  a dem also won the new jersey governorship.    oh, to be a fly on the wall at the republican national committee this morning.  we guess lots of meetings, naval gazing and finger pointing, no?  but this is bigger than an off-year election. the real story may be those in congress who have decided to hang it up.  two more gop representatives announced they’re bowing out next year, making nearly two dozen republicans leaving congress rather than face mid-term trump tantrums from voters.  less than half a dozen democrats have announced retirements.  still, it's a long time until the 2018 election, but make no mistake, last night was a referendum on donald trump.  and he lost.  bigly.  ezra klein at vox says trumpism without trump is toast.
republican ed gillespie's gubernatorial loss in virginia is being dissected this morning. in an opinion piece on the hill, contributor evan mcmullin says one reason for the outcome is that fearmongering didn't work:  "gillespie’s television ads stoking fear of latino immigrants by associating them with the gang ms-13, even though virginia has one of the lowest violent crime rates in the nation, was one such thing. another was his ad in which he drew a clear distinction between his opponent’s desire to remove confederate statues and his own plan to keep them at a time when white supremacists are fighting for the same."
take a moment tonight to read this.  it's a really smart take on mental health and mass shootings.  it's written by alexander, a college senior in washington, dc. we are privileged to have so many smart followers and good writers out there!    ___  "reject this. this take, vaguely linking mental illness to mass murder and arguing that americans who are living with a mental health condition are predisposed to violence, is dangerous, stigmatizing, and disheartening. it is especially bad when it’s coming from gun control advocates, popular liberal media figures, and left-wing politicians. 19% of all american adults (≈45 million) currently live with a mental illness, with 10+ million having a “serious” condition. 23% of all american adults use medication to treat a mental condition, and 48% of americans sought treatment for mental health-related issues in 2016. on top of this, 44% of all americans attended counseling last year. 22% of american youth (13-18 years old) will experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life, with 13% of children between 8-12 currently experiencing a mental illness that “seriously interferes with one or more major life activities.” everyone living in the u.s. knows someone else currently dealing with a mental illness. in fact, an apa study reported that 91% of all american adults have aided friends/family in seeking mental health treatment, and/or have provided emotional support to someone with a mental health condition. by disseminating this viewpoint in the wake of a national tragedy, that people living with a mental illness are dangerous, gun-toting murderers ready to strike innocent americans when they least expect it, you are automatically stigmatizing 65+ million americans. americans that don’t possess the twisted conscience to commit depraved acts of mass violence. in fact, people with underlying mental health problems are over 50x more likely to commit an act of self-inflicted violence, rather than against other people. mental illness is *not* the main predictor of a mass shooting. it’s a lazy, debunked scapegoat meant invoke fear in neurotypical americans and distract from larger societal issues. nearly 20% of all mass killings in the u.s. since 2006 involve a perpetrator with a convicted history of domestic violence. when the killer targets friends/family, that percentage jumps up to 35%. in 55% of all mass shootings since 2006, the perpetrator also shot a family member, whether they were the primary target or not. the relationship between domestic violence and mass homicide cannot be understated. it requires further research and media exposure, instead of the fear-mongering we see coming from mainstream political commentators today. in the tragedy we collectively experienced yesterday, the perpetrator was a known domestic abuser. beating his ex-wife and stepson, he also sent “threatening text messages” to his mother-in-law, a member of the first baptist church in sutherland springs, tx. this isn’t a unique case. whether it’s las vegas or orlando, virginia tech or newtown, or san bernardino and sutherland springs, some of the most dangerous “lone wolf” rampage killers in modern american history are strung together by a common thread: their abuse of women and children. the one factor that unites these cases isn’t religious or political extremism, mental illness or financial hardships, but rather the killers’ known history of domestic violence. if we were to deny the access of guns to domestic abusers, 848 americans killed between 2009-2016 would still be with us, not counting those who have lost their lives in 2017. over 60% of all women murdered in the u.s. are killed by men they know. women in the u.s. are nearly 16x more likely to be killed by a gun than women in other developed nations, a number that is directly related to the prevalence of domestic abuse in our country. in 42% of all mass shootings between 2006-2016, the shooter exhibited early warning signs to family members, with nearly half of those cases involving the significant other of the shooter. don’t stigmatize people living with a mental illness. stigmatize people who have a tendency to beat women and children. stigmatize people who have restraining orders against them for abuse-related offenses. i’m not saying that we shouldn’t conduct background checks on people with mental illnesses who are seeking to purchase a firearm. that’s not the point of this post. i’m also not saying that we shouldn’t outright deny the sale of a gun to certain people with serious mental conditions, because that’s absurd and dangerous as well. also, i know that devin kelley wasn't supposed to possess firearms either because of a domestic violence conviction, yet he bought them anyways due to a bureaucratic failure on behalf of the air force. what i am advocating for is a shift in the discourse. reject the argument that people living with mental illnesses are predisposed to violence, because that’s just untrue. reject the takes by politicians that mental illness is a predictor of mass shootings, and don’t allow policy to be influenced by such nonsense claims. if you want to ban a specific group from owning firearms, ban the group that puts their hands on family members, children, and significant others. info from the cdc, nimh, fbi, everytown, nami, apa, afsp, and so on. you can look up the research/infographics on your own time."

to the surprise of absolutely no one, revised medicaid criteria unveiled today will mean fewer americans get health coverage.  the department of health and human services is allowing states to mandate that medicaid recipients be working to receive benefits.  unfortunately, more than 70% of medicaid recipients are disabled and many can't work.  so, the man with the "beautiful" plan cuts them off?  donald trump's administrator for medicaid said the changes are designed to get people (mostly poor and disabled), to “move up, move on, and move out” of the program.  good luck with that.  here's a good explainer from talking points memo:
it's an off year election, which usually doesn't attract much attention or many voters.  but this is not a normal year.  our fire-breathing president has turned off a few folks, and if you're so inclined, today would be a good opportunity to show him, and his party, what you think of the happenings in the white house.  donald trump's name will not appear on any ballot, but he's there.  big wins by the gop in state races will be an affirmation of current national policies.  however you vote,  just do it.  complaints here plus two bucks will get you a cup of coffee.  you have a powerful voice.  didn't vote last november?  see what happened?  the good people at npr have important elections to watch across the country.
donald trump is still saying it's too soon to talk gun control. he also questions whether it is even appropriate to ask questions about guns right now.   we are pretty sure no matter how many times reporters ask him this question, they are going to get the same answer. to trump it looks like it's never the time to talk about gun control. it's up to congress to take this matter up and it's never too soon to save other lives.

in timelines that have become all too common, mass shootings in america are quickly followed by our fearless political leaders offering thoughts and prayers.  sometimes it’s just thoughts. sometimes it’s condolences.  it always comes via social media, usually before the number of victims are counted.  a quick “thoughts and prayers” and just like that politicians are off the hook.  a one-line “prayers are with you” from a staffer on twitter and that’s the end of it.   except it’s not the end.  it’s just the beginning of the wait before the next time.  it’s as if offering a prayer absolves those who could help of all responsibility.  politicians could act.  but they don't.  aren't public servants supposed to be "serving" the public rather than their egos?  what’s the tipping point for legislation?  is there one?  fifty-seven dead in las vegas didn’t do it.  certainly twenty-six in texas will hardly raise an eyebrow.  the mass shootings garner the media attention, but this is a much bigger issue.  it’s really a full blown national crisis.  can you imagine 30,000 people dying a year in airplane crashes? there would be more congressional hearings than you could count.  about the same number of people, 33,000 die from opioid abuse and that’s a national emergency in donald trump’s america.  the same number are killed by guns and not a peep.  nothing can even be considered, no ideas brought forward before they are dismissed by the nra, er, congress.  we didn’t build the most powerful nation in the world throwing up our hands and shrugging our shoulders.    something has to be done.  we now live in the land of fear.  no school, no church, no concert, no office is safe.  where’s next?  america’s gun problem is soberingly displayed here in a recent piece from the guardian.
several members of the saudi royal family are under arrest in what is being called a political purge. it’s a story that is having an impact here in the us, as oil prices rise and the stock market reacts.   reuters reports:  saudi arabia’s future king has tightened his grip on power through an anti-corruption purge by arresting royals, ministers and investors including billionaire alwaleed bin talal who is one of the kingdom’s most prominent businessmen.  prince alwaleed, a nephew of the king and owner of investment firm kingdom holding (4280.se), invests in firms such as citigroup (c.n) and twitter (twtr.n). he was among 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers detained, three senior officials told reuters on sunday.  the purge against the kingdom’s political and business elite also targeted the head of the national guard, prince miteb bin abdullah, who was detained and replaced as minister of the powerful national guard by prince khaled bin ayyaf.  the allegations against prince alwaleed include money laundering, bribery and extorting officials, one official told reuters, while prince miteb is accused of embezzlement, hiring ghost employees and awarding contracts to his own companies including a $10 billion (7.65 billion pounds) deal for walkie talkies and bulletproof military gear worth billions of saudi riyals.

we now know more about senator rand paul’s injuries and it looks like he may not be returning to work anytime soon.   the week reports:  sen. rand paul (r-ky.) has five rib fractures, including three displaced fractures, and is in too much pain to fly back to washington, d.c., following an altercation on friday with a neighbor at his home in kentucky, paul's chief strategist said sunday.  in a statement, doug stafford said the type of injury paul sustained "is caused by high velocity severe force. it is not clear exactly how soon he will return to work, as the pain is considerable as is the difficulty in getting around, including flying." he also said paul has lung contusions, and displaced rib fractures can lead to pneumonia, internal bleeding, and laceration of internal organs.
we have learned the shooter in the texas church massacre is a 26-year-old white male. so far we don't see many of the country's top politicians condemning him, instead most just seem to be sending thoughts and prayers. here is some reaction from twitter:  president donald trump: "may god be w/ the people of sutherland springs, texas. the fbi & law enforcement are on the scene. i am monitoring the situation from japan."  senator ted cruz: "keeping all harmed in sutherland springs in our prayers and grateful for our brave first responders on the scene."  speaker of the house paul ryan: "reports out of texas are devastating. the people of sutherland springs need our prayers right now."  vice president mike pence: "karen & i send prayers to victims & their families in tx.we grieve w/ you & stand w/ resolve against evil. thank you to the first responders"  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell: "elaine & i join w fellow senators in sending condolences to the sutherland springs community, our prayers are w the victims & their families"  in contrast, just hours after the attack in ny last week trump's first reaction in the form of a tweet was, "in nyc, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. law enforcement is following this closely. not in the u.s.a.!" and "we must not allow isis to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the middle east and elsewhere. enough!?"

using the richard nixon model for impeachment, the current president crossed a line today that could find him facing the same consequences.   from slate.com:  “in short, the house judiciary committee voted to impeach nixon because he sought to turn the immense power of the justice department and federal criminal investigative agencies against his political adversaries. although these articles of impeachment were never approved by the full house of representatives because nixon resigned before a vote could be taken, it received more votes in committee than any other proposed article. no respectable scholar of the constitution doubts that directing the criminal justice and intelligence systems of the united states against political opponents, for purposes unrelated to the impartial enforcement of the law or preservation of legitimate national security interests, is among the impeachable “high crimes and misdemeanors” of article ii, section 4.”

"donald trump used to say climate change is a hoax. the government just confirmed it isn't"   that's the headline from this time magazine report:  a sweeping federal report released friday stressed that climate change poses a grave threat to the u.s. — from the dangers of rapidly increasing temperatures to rising sea levels — challenging the trump administration’s unwillingness to address global warming.  the climate change report, known as the national climate assessment, predicts that sea levels could rise by as much as eight feet by the end of the century, average annual temperatures will continue to rise and forest fires will continue to grow in severity. humans are “extremely likely” to be responsible for global warming and that “there is no convincing alternative explanation,” researchers write.

"thank you mr president (a few others trollers), for translating my new book into trumpspeak. #notwhatisaid."  "donald trump says i said “dnc rigged the system…” first of all, i don’t speak in caps! #notwhatisaid"  senator bernie sanders is also reacting to trump's tweets on brazile's revelations saying: "we won't be distracted from your efforts to give billionaires tax cuts, take health care from millions and deny climate change. do your job."  as for what brazile really meant? and what was her motivation to release her claims now... take a look at this opinion piece in huffpost.

donald trump nominates jerome powell to lead the federal reserve. he's a republican, but was appointed by former president barack obama to his current job five years ago. many believe he will easily be confirmed.  reuters has more:  president donald trump on thursday tapped fed governor jerome powell to become head of the u.s. central bank, promoting a soft-spoken centrist to replace janet yellen when her term expires in february 2018.  powell, appointed to the fed board in 2012 by then-president barack obama, emerged as trump’s choice from a five-person slate of possible nominees that included yellen as well as others who would have represented a sharp change in monetary policy.  in an announcement at the white house, trump called powell a strong, committed and smart leader.  “he has proved to be a consensus builder for the sound monetary and financial policy that he believes in ... based on his record i am confident that jay has the wisdom and leadership to guide our economy,” trump said as the fed nominee looked on.  the decision, which ended an unusually public, months-long search, offers a bit of both worlds, allowing trump to select a new fed chief while getting continuity with a yellen-run central bank that has kept the economy and markets on an even keel.  powell, a 64-year-old lawyer and former investment banker, has backed yellen’s general direction on monetary policy and, in recent years, shared her concerns that weak inflation justified a continued cautious approach to raising interest rates.  in june, he laid out both a defense of the fed’s gradualist path and a critique of those, including some of his competitors for the fed’s top job, who argued that the central bank had increased the risk of high inflation and other problems.  trump on several occasions has said he would prefer rates to stay low, a position at odds with some of those who were on his short list for the fed job, particularly stanford university economist john taylor and former fed governor kevin warsh. top white house economic adviser gary cohn also was a contender.  praises fed patience  powell has been a reliable supporter of the consensus forged by yellen on the policy-setting federal open market committee, and likely will be seen as a less risky choice with the economy growing solidly and u.s. stock markets near record highs.  the fed has raised rates twice this year and is widely expected to do so again next month.  ”the (fomc) has been patient in raising rates, and that patience has paid dividends,“ powell said in his remarks to the economic club of new york in june.”  “after a tumultuous decade, the economy is now close to full employment and price stability. the problems that some commentators predicted have not come to pass. accommodative policy did not generate high inflation or excessive credit growth.”  but powell has gone further than his colleagues in calling to relax some of the stricter regulations imposed after the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession, also one of trump’s goals. powell can now pursue that end along with trump appointee randal quarles, the fed’s new vice chair for supervision.  though he will be the first fed chief since the late 1970s without an advanced degree in economics, powell brings market insights, fed board experience and ties to the republican party that analysts argued likely make for a smooth transition and relatively easy senate confirmation.  under president george h.w. bush, powell oversaw policy on financial institutions and debt markets as an undersecretary of the treasury. from 1997 to 2005 he was a partner at the carlyle group, a private equity firm, and focused on public debt dynamics while at the bipartisan policy center think tank.  “the kernel of what this boiled down to is that in selecting powell, (trump) has all but selected yellen,” said sarah binder, a political science professor at george washington university and author of a recent book on fed politics. “there is not really much daylight, if any.”  yellen is entitled to remain as a fed governor until 2024, though previous central bank chiefs have traditionally not stayed once a successor was in place.

we now know a lot more about donald trump's tax plan. a couple of the most controversial parts involve limiting the deduction of mortgage interest for newly purchased homes and rolling back some of the local and state tax deductions.   here are details from reuters:  president donald trump’s drive for the deep tax cuts that he promised as a candidate reached a major milestone on thursday, with his fellow republicans in the house of representatives unveiling long-awaited legislation to overhaul the tax code.  the legislation called for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and reducing the number of tax brackets for individuals, according to a summary document obtained by reuters.  largely in line with expectations for the tax-cut plan they have been developing behind closed doors for weeks, the house tax-writing ways and means committee proposed doubling the standard deduction for individuals and families, capping the deduction for state and local property taxes at $10,000 and maintaining the current tax treatment of 401(k) and ira retirement plans.  the bill is the starting gun for a frantic race toward what trump and republicans in the house and senate hope will be their first major legislative victory since he took office in january: the enactment this year of a package with up to $6 trillion in tax cuts over the next decade for corporations, small businesses and individuals.  the bill would create new a family tax credit, maintain deductions for mortgage interest for existing loans and newly purchased homes up to $500,000, double exemptions for estate taxes on inherited assets, repeal estate taxes after six years and allow small businesses to write off loan interest, according to the document.  congress has not succeeded on comprehensive tax changes since 1986, when republican ronald reagan was in the white house and democrats controlled the house. bipartisan cooperation led to the passage of that plan three decades ago, but republicans have frozen democrats out of the process of developing this legislation and passed a budget plan that would enable them to pass it with no democratic votes.  independent analysts have said that, based on an outline of the plan previously made public, corporations and the wealthiest americans would benefit the most, and the federal deficit would be greatly expanded over the next decade because of a loss of tax revenue.  trump said at the white house this week that he wanted congress to pass the tax overhaul by the u.s. thanksgiving holiday on nov. 23.  the tax-writing house ways and means committee has been drafting the bill, and republican chairman kevin brady has promised to release it on thursday. a spokesman for republican house speaker paul ryan said it would be formally announced at 11:15 a.m. (1515 gmt).  trump, house republican leaders and republican members of brady’s panel will then meet at the white house on thursday afternoon. trump is also meeting separately with republican senators, who must also unite to pass the tax plan.  “this is the beginning of the end of this horrible tax code,” brady told reporters on thursday as he entered a meeting with republican lawmakers ahead of the bill’s release.  “we’re going to get it done,” added house republican leader kevin mccarthy.  still, important issues remain unresolved and brady himself predicts the initial legislation will change next week, when his panel is due to begin preparing it for an eventual house vote.  while republicans control the white house and both chambers of congress, intra-party differences have prevented them from passing major legislation sought by trump, as exemplified by the collapse of their effort to dismantle the obamacare law. any failure to pass tax cuts legislation would call into question republicans’ basic ability to deliver on promises.  the bill must also pass the senate, where republicans hold a slimmer 52-48 majority and earlier this year failed to garner enough votes to pass a major healthcare overhaul. senate republican leaders have said they aim to finish their work on taxes by year-end.  democrats have criticized the proposed tax cuts as a giveaway to corporations and the wealthy that would harm workers and middle-class americans.
there is no doubt about it, many late-night comedians are doing some of the best, most stinging commentary in regards to donald trump. seth meyers, stephen colbert, jimmy kimmel and trevor noah are especially shining.  take this clip from noah’s the daily show about why it was not okay to talk about gun control after las vegas, but it's okay for donald trump (and his supporters) to talk about immigration immediately after the terror attack in nyc.

the ny terror suspect now faces federal charges, as the fbi announces they are looking to question another person in connection to the attack.  the ap reports:  federal prosecutors have charged a uzbek immigrant with a terrorism charge related to the deadly truck attack on a new york bike path.  suspect sayfullo saipov was charged wednesday in a criminal complaint in the tuesday afternoon attack that killed eight people near the world trade center.  the complaint says he drove the truck down the bike lane intentionally. investigators say they recovered a cellphone that had islamic state group propaganda.  a court proceeding is scheduled in federal court. it’s unclear whether the man will appear. he was shot by police and hospitalized.
from the ap:  president donald trump is calling the suspect in the new york city truck attack an “animal.”  trump says he will ask congress to “immediately” begin work to terminate the diversity immigrant visa program, which he says was used by the alleged attacker to enter the united states. officials have not yet said that was the case.  trump says “we will take all necessary steps to protect our people.”  speaking before a cabinet meeting at the white house, trump said “all of america is praying and grieving” with the victims. he says: “our hearts break for them.”  trump also says he will consider sending the suspected new york city truck attacker to the prison in guantanamo bay, cuba.  responding to a shouted question from a reporter at a cabinet meeting, trump says, “i would certainly consider that. send him to gitmo.”  trump’s comments come after sen. lindsey graham, r-s.c., called on the president to treat the alleged attacker as an enemy combatant. the suspect is currently in custody in new york city, but according to officials has not yet been formally charged.
new york governor andrew cuomo reacts to donald trump's tweets about the ny terror attack saying:  "the president's tweets i think were not helpful, i do not think they were factual. i think they tended to point fingers and politicize the situation."  these were trump's tweets that cuomo was referring to:  "i have just ordered homeland security to step up our already extreme vetting program. being politically correct is fine, but not for this!"  "the terrorist came into our country through what is called the "diversity visa lottery program," a chuck schumer beauty. i want merit based."  "we are fighting hard for merit based immigration, no more democrat lottery systems. we must get much tougher (and smarter).  @foxandfriends"  see what else governor cuomo had to say.

new york is my home.  many of us were here 16 years ago when 9/11 happened in downtown manhattan.  that horrible day changed everyone in some way or other.  the casualty count from today's attack is minuscule by comparison but no less painful for those who were injured or lost loved ones or friends.    but now something is different.  hours after today's attack, the annual halloween parade went off as scheduled. restaurants are packed tonight.  the streets are busy.   we go on with our lives.  for the first time this year there's a crispness in the air.  there's also a resilience that surprised me.  we've watched terror attacks across the globe for more that a decade.  the attitude today is different.  yes, terrorism caused tremendous tragedy in our city.  but it didn't change us.  it didn't instill the same kind of fear, which is the point of terrorism after all...

update from the ap on ny terror attack:   new york mayor: 8 dead on bike path near world trade center in 'an act of terror' aimed at civilians.  new york gov. cuomo says vehicle driving on bike path was 'lone wolf' attack; no evidence it was part of wider plot.
breaking: several people are said to be dead or injured in what is being called "a deliberate act" in new york city.   cnn reports that up to six people are dead after a truck drove down a bike path in lower manhattan for several blocks, mowing down pedestrians and bicyclists. the suspect was then shot by police, but reportedly survived.   the nypd is reporting, "currently there is one person in custody. no others outstanding. all information is preliminary as the investigation is ongoing."
in case there was any question before about white house chief of staff john kelly, i think we can officially say that he has jumped the shark. his interview on fox news last night showed he is nothing more than a puppet for donald trump.  it was a big topic at today’s white house briefing as sarah huckabee sanders was asked about kelly’s comments and repeatedly defended him.
calling america’s political leaders cowards is becoming commonplace.  how about disgraceful?  stronger words could easily be used, especially after yesterday when our congressional “leaders” stood silently on the sidelines, hands in pockets.  and to what end?  what agenda is more important than our country?   their silence gave us the answer. from vox:  “the founding fathers carried a mistrust of the popular will; they understood full well that the american people might, at some point, elect a demagogue or a knave to the white house, and so they built countervailing institutions capable of binding an errant executive. congress wasn’t meant to ignore a rogue, lawless, or indisciplined white house — it was meant to overwhelm it, to contain it.”
the denials coming from a smartphone inside the white house this morning seem hollow at best, outright lies at worst.  please read the following from lawfare blog to understand just how serious this has become.  it’s a great piece that gives context and perspective to the special counsel’s actions.  and robert mueller has only just begun.   “president trump, in short, had on his campaign at least one person, and allegedly two people, who actively worked with adversarial foreign governments in a fashion they sought to criminally conceal from investigators. one of them ran the campaign. the other, meanwhile, was interfacing with people he “understood to have substantial connections to russian government officials” and with a person introduced to him as “a relative of russian president vladimir putin with connections to senior russian government officials.” all of this while president trump was assuring the american people that he and his campaign had "nothing to do with russia."
donald trump is now reacting to the guilty plea from former adviser george papadopoulos. he is acknowledging that papadopoulos is a liar, but he also seems to be insinuating he didn't really know "george." on twitter, trump said:   "the fake news is working overtime. as paul manaforts lawyer said, there was "no collusion" and events mentioned took place long before he came to the campaign. few people knew the young, low level volunteer named george, who has already proven to be a liar. check the dems!"  cnn though pulled a clip with someone who did know papadopoulos, it's none other than trump himself.

halloween tuesday cover from the new york daily news.
looks like donald trump skipped work this morning to watch the indictments unfold on tv, but what he didn’t bargain for was a guilty plea from a former adviser. after that news broke trump reportedly became very angry and agitated.  the washington post reports:  president trump woke before dawn on monday and burrowed in at the white house residence to wait for the russia bombshell he knew was coming.  separated from most of his west wing staff — who fretted over why he was late getting to the oval office — trump clicked on the television and spent the morning playing fuming media critic, legal analyst and crisis communications strategist, according to several people close to him.  the president digested the news of the first indictments in special counsel robert s. mueller iii’s probe with exasperation and disgust, these people said. he called his lawyers repeatedly. he listened intently to cable news commentary. and, with rising irritation, he watched live footage of his onetime campaign adviser and confidant, paul manafort, turning himself in to the fbi.
12 years is a long time in prison.  especially if, like paul manafort, you’re 68 years old.  if you put together the pieces here, robert mueller has given the former trump campaign chairman a stark choice.  cooperate or possibly spend your golden years in big house.  it’s obvious mueller thinks manafort knows more than he’s letting on.  so, released from prison when you’re 80?  dying in prison?  strong incentive indeed. via bloomberg.

another donald trump policy blocked by the courts...  breaking from the ap:   a federal court in washington is barring president donald trump from changing the government’s policy on military service by transgender people.  trump announced in an august memo that he intended to reverse course on a 2016 policy that allowed troops to serve openly as transgender individuals. he said he would order a return to the policy prior to june 2016, under which service members could be discharged for being transgender.  u.s. district judge colleen kollar-kotelly wrote monday that transgender members of the military who had sued over the change were likely to win their lawsuit and barred the trump administration from reversing course.
we now know a lot more about the guilty plea from ex-trump adviser george papadopoulos.  the atlantic reports:  on march 31, 2016, papadopoulos attended a trump campaign meeting in which he claimed he could arrange a meeting between trump and putin. the washington post had previously reported on that offer, which apparently concerned trump campaign officials, who worried such a meeting might be improper at best and illegal at worst. over the coming weeks, however, papadopoulos continued to try to establish meetings between russian officials and the trump team.  the biggest revelation in the plea agreement concerns an april 26 meeting in london. papadopoulos met with the professor, who told him that the russians had “dirt” on democratic candidate hillary clinton. the government filing says the professor said that “the russians had emails of clinton,” and in fact “thousands of emails.”
we now have a guilty plea in the mueller investigation and reaction from donald trump.  trump has now reacted via twitter saying:  "sorry, but this is years ago, before paul manafort was part of the trump campaign. but why aren't crooked hillary & the dems the focus????? ...also, there is no collusion!"  however after that tweet we learned that former trump campaign aide george papadopoulos had pled guilty to lying to fbi agents. nbc news andrea mitchell reports "papadopoulos pleads guilty 1 count making false statements re ties to russians to dig up clinton dirt."  abc news dan abrams says, "george papadopolous pleading should be more concerning to trump team than manafort indictment. it almost certainly means he is cooperating."
here's the official 31 page, 12 count indictment against paul manafort and richard gates.  among the charges:  -conspiracy against the united states. manafort and gates together with others, knowingly and intentionally conspired to defraud the united states by impeding, impairing, obstructing and defeating the lawful governmental functions of a government agency, namely the department of justice and the department of the treasury,  and to commit offenses against the united states   -manafort and gates acted as unregistered agents of the government of ukraine  -manafort and gates funneled millions of dollars in payments into foreign nominee companies and bank accounts, opened by them and their accomplices in nominee names  -manafort and gates concealed from the united states their work as agents of, and millions of dollars in payments from, ukraine and its political parties and leaders  -manafort used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the united states, without paying taxes on that income  -in total more than $75,000,000 flowed through offshore accounts. manafort laundered more than $18,000,000
update: the ap is now reporting paul manafort has been indicted on conspiracy against the united states, money laundering and several other charges.   cnn is reporting that some of this activity happened while manafort was donald trump’s campaign chairman.   as we wait for reaction from donald trump or his press office, here is video from the washington post of paul manafort, trump's former campaign manager, entering an fbi field office in washington dc.  the ap reports:  president donald trump’s former campaign chairman, paul manafort, and a former business associate, rick gates, surrendered to federal authorities monday. that’s according to people familiar with the matter.  the charges are the first in special counsel robert mueller’s investigation into potential coordination between russia and the trump campaign. details on the charges have not been released.  manafort and gates surrendered to federal authorities in washington. they are expected in court later monday to face charges brought by mueller’s team. that’s according to one person familiar with the investigation. a second person said that gates had worked out an arrangement to turn himself in on monday.  the people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss publicly an ongoing federal probe.
for all those celebrating the actions of the special counsel, take note; this is a very dangerous time for our country.  we are one “firing” away from a constitutional crisis. if robert mueller goes, all bets are off.   you have a president divorced from reality, a massive propaganda machine in fox news brainwashing millions of americans daily and a congress that has the spine of a worm.  from vox:  “the fate of the investigation — and of the integrity of the american political process — will thus rest on the often frail shoulders of the handful of congressional republicans who’ve made it clear that they understand the threat trump poses to the country but have never yet managed to conduct effective, coordinated political action to counter the threat. if they want to forestall disaster, that needs to change. and it needs to happen fast, before trump plunges us into a new round of crisis.”

for those of you old enough to remember, or for those students of american history, you'll no doubt recall the term "unindicted co-conspirator" was used to describe richard nixon during watergate.  a sitting president can't be indicted, but his crimes didn't go unnoticed.  the watergate grand jury used the term in secret indictments returned against other conspirators in early 1974.  it was eventually reported in the los angeles times in june 1974.  richard nixon resigned on august 9, 1974.  could robert mueller follow his watergate predecessors?  is donald trump headed for the same fate?  slate.com has a great read.

remember when donald trump promised to lower health insurance premiums and deductibles? in reality, some people are learning the price of insurance is increasing more than the congressional budget office estimated.   this week many people started to get their new rates in the mail. here’s one we were sent where the premium increases about 28% and the deductible rises more than 20%. in this case, a family of 4 is now set to pay more than $24,000 a year (plus co-pays) in health insurance alone. that prices out a good portion of the middle class. even if a family is earning $100,000 a year, how can they swing putting a quarter of that income into insurance?  we are curious to see how your new rates stack up to this and how it will effect your coverage in the next year.

donald trump promised "we will defeat this #opioidepidemic & free our nation from the terrible affliction of drug abuse."  but many people say his declaration didn't go nearly as far as he seemed to insinuate it would.  here's the story from reuters:  doug corcoran is in the trenches every day in the fight against the opioid crisis in the rural ohio county he helps oversee.  so president donald trump’s failure this week to formally declare the overdose epidemic a “national emergency” - words that would have freed up more federal funds to tackle the crisis - was disappointing for him.  “i have been hopeful for the last several years that the federal government would step up and help us with this crisis, and they haven’t. they’ve really dropped the ball on this and it’s sad,” said corcoran, a county commissioner in ross county, home to 77,000 people an hour south of columbus, ohio.  the county’s child services budget nearly doubled in the past five years to almost $2.4 million from $1.3 million, because of the number of children needing care due to addicted parents. for a county with a general fund of $23 million, that is a stress on the finances.  corcoran struggles constantly to make funds available from the county budget for the likes of drug treatment centers, the county jail and anti-drug education programs.  the disappointment about trump’s announcement is more bitter in ross county given that more than 60 percent of the county voted for the republican at last year’s presidential election against democrat hillary clinton.  across the country  corcoran, who attended a youth education event about opioids on friday in the city of chillicothe, is not alone as the crisis strains local budgets across the country.  brian namey, a spokesman for the national association of counties, which represents 3,069 county and local governments, said trump’s declaration on thursday that the opioid crisis is a “public health emergency” rather than a national emergency lasts only 90 days and frees up no additional federal funds.  “we strongly urge the administration to release additional money to confront this emergency,” namey said.  the opioid epidemic played a role in more than 33,000 deaths in 2015, according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention. the death rate has kept rising, both in cities and in many rural areas across the country, estimates show.  opioids, primarily prescription painkillers, in addition to heroin and fentanyl - a pain medicine 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine - are fueling the drug overdoses. more than 100 americans die daily from related overdoses, according to the cdc.  republican lawmakers called the president’s declaration an important step in combating the crisis. some critics, including democratic lawmakers, said it was meaningless without additional funding.  the national association of county and city health officials (naccho), representing nearly 3,000 local health departments, also expressed disappointment that trump did not go further and call the crisis a national emergency.  “the declaration of an opioid public health emergency and not a state of national emergency does not go far enough,” said naccho’s laura hanen, the association’s interim executive director. “we strongly urge the administration to act further and release additional monies to bring this emergency to an end.”  matt osterberg is a county commissioner in rural pike county, pennsylvania. he said the county jail has roughly 120 inmates, the majority of whom are incarcerated for a drug-related crime.  the county of 55,000 has an overall annual budget of $42 million. it spends $3.5 million annually treating drug addicts inside the jail, but often when inmates are released they start taking drugs again and end up back behind bars.  additional federal funds would be vital to help finance treatment centers for inmates once they are released, something the county cannot afford.  “if people got proper intensive treatment after they get out of jail, that would be my dream,” osterberg said.
the wall street journal confirms cnn reporting that at least one person has been charged in connection with special counsel’s robert mueller’s investigation.

julian assange has confirmed that a data firm, hired by the trump campaign, tried to get its hands on hillary clinton's emails. the big question is whether any part of this is illegal.  cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin and michael zeldin, former special assistant to special counsel robert mueller, break down the possible legal implications.  toobin: "this is one of the key things about the collusion investigation. it's not clear what federal crimes might be committed, it could be aiding and abetting hacking. it could be some sort of money laundering"  zeldin: "when you have a campaign...saying can you give me stolen material or can we participate in the distribution of stolen material? i think it in implicates the anti-hacking statute, i think it implicates the possibility of defrauding the federal elections commission, the integrity of our election..."

just minutes after president trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency, he blamed mexico for the epidemic and brought up the wall. here's part of his speech:  "an astonishing 90% of the heroin in america comes from south of the border, where we will be building a wall, which will greatly help in this problem."

you may have seen an ad pop up on tv stations over the last day or so calling for donald trump's impeachment. the ad is actually part of a $10 million campaign from california billionaire tom steyer. steyer describes himself as a "california business leader. philanthropist. advanced energy advocate. founder and president @nextgenamerica." nextgen america is a company that "acts to prevent climate disaster, promote prosperity, and protect the fundamental rights of every american."   so what grounds does steyer say he has for impeachment? he lays it out in this 60 second ad and also says:   "founding father alexander hamilton, a co-author of the federalist papers — and an immigrant himself — argued that 'high crimes and misdemeanors' could be defined as 'abuse or violation of some public trust.' this president has clearly already exceeded these standards. congress has impeached past presidents for far less."
it looks like charlottesville may have been the turning point for some of donald trump's biggest critics in the senate.  washington post reports:  "sen. bob corker (r-tenn.) had his problems with president trump before the violence in the virginia city in august, in which a counterprotester was killed during a white supremacist rally organized in defense of confederate statues. but it is when trump blamed both sides for the unrest — white supremacists chanting “jews will not replace us” and the activists condemning them — that corker's critiques of the president gained momentum."  and the report goes on to say:  "sen. jeff flake (r-ariz.) announced tuesday that he will not seek reelection and took trump to task in a post op-ed, even alluding to his controversial comments after the charlottesville unrest.  “how many more times will we see moral ambiguity in the face of shocking bigotry and shrug it off,” flake asked."
breaking: republican senator jeff flake of arizona announces he won't seek re-election in 2018. as he made the announcement he offered an extremely strong critique of the white house, the strongest attack on donald trump (and those who support him) that we have seen from any republican senator to date.  here is some of what flake said:   "there are times when we must risk our careers in favor of our principles.”  "we must never regard as normal, the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals.”  "mr. president, i rise today to say: enough. we must dedicate ourselves to making sure that the anomalous never becomes normal. with respect and humility, i must say that we have fooled ourselves for long enough that a pivot to governing is right around the corner, a return to civility and stability right behind it. we know better than that. by now, we all know better than that."
donald trump has been criticized in the last week by former president george w. bush and senators john mccain and bob corker...to name a few.   with that in mind today senate majority leader mitch mcconnell was asked, "at what point do you have an obligation of the leader of this party to weigh in on these very serious criticisms of the president?"  his response? let's call it dodge and chuckle. he laughed off the question and danced around the answer.

general joseph dunford, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, held a news conference today to talk about the deadly ambush in niger that left four servicemen dead.  one thing that stood out was his tone. it seemed different from how the administration has handled information surrounding this incident and so many others. for instance, when confronted with a question about why sgt. la david johnson's widow hasn't been able to see her husband's body, dunford didn't call the widow a liar, he didn't try to make excuses or take it personally. instead he offered what seemed like a reasoned, honest answer.
senator john mccain talks to the view about how donald trump has criticized and threatened him in the past. he also addresses whether he ever speaks to the president and reacts to trump's past criticism of himself and other pows.
it’s come to this. nine months into donald trump’s term, a major news organization has produced an ad aimed at the president and his lies. and the fact that cnn feels it needs to fight back says volumes. trump’s strategy is working. blaming the press for all his problems, saying facts are fake, raging against the media for making up stories—which are true—is unfortunately resonating in parts of our country. it’s a clever ad, but a sad day for america.
megyn kelly is reacting to the new york times report that bill o'reilly settled a sexual harassment claim for $32 million, before fox news signed him to a new contract.  kelly's opening statement today on her nbc show was one of the most powerful rebukes we have heard of fox news and it was told from her own personal experience.   this segment is a must-watch. here's an excerpt:  "it gives me no pleasure to report such news about my former employer, which has made some reforms since all of this went down. but this must stop. the abuse of women, the shaming of them, the threatening, the retaliation, the silencing of them after the fact, it has to stop."
myeshia johnson, the widow of fallen soldier sgt. la david johnson talked to good morning america about what happened to her husband in niger and the call she received from donald trump. here's part of the interview:   "whatever miss wilson said was not fabricated. what she said was 100% correct."   "the president said that he knew what he signed up for, but it hurts anyways and i was -- it made me cry because i was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said it. he couldn't remember my husband's name."   note: trump is already tweeting out what clearly seems to be his reaction to this interview. he is contradicting the widow's story saying, "i had a very respectful conversation with the widow of sgt. la david johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!"
when the white house press secretary was asked today whether chief of staff john kelly would apologize for false remarks he made about congresswoman frederica wilson, sarah sanders fought back, saying:  "if you want to go after general kelly, that's up to you. if you want to get into a debate with a four-star marine general. i think that's highly inappropriate."    check out the rather testy exchange between sanders and cbs's chip reid.
former president george w. bush doesn't often speak in public, but today he delivered a rather strong speech about the state of our country.   he covered russia's involvement in the election, white supremacy, immigration and more. while he never spoke donald trump's name, with statements like the following, the speech was a clear assessment of trump's policies.  "too often we judge other groups by their worst examples while judging ourselves by our best intentions, forgetting the image of god we should see in each other."   "we’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism."
the outcry is growing today on both sides of the aisle over what happened to four service members in niger. msnbc's rachel maddow says donald trump has been trying to "divert the conversation from what happened to those soldiers" and "that makes me really want to know what happened in niger."  take a look at what else she had to say...
new information on the phone call donald trump made to one of the families of a service member who was killed in niger. white house press secretary sarah sanders was asked whether the president told sgt. la david t. johnson's widow that her husband "knew what he signed up for." an account now backed up by johnson's mother. sanders doesn't deny that donald trump made the comment, but she maintains he was respectful.  she was also asked to clarify the proof trump was referring to in this tweet: "democrat congresswoman totally fabricated what i said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and i have proof). sad!"  here's what she said.
donald trump announces "specifics" of his tax plan while meeting with the senate finance committee. he says "the largest tax cut in the history of our country" will include:  -double amount of income taxed at zero bracket -increase in the child tax credit -end estate tax -cut business tax rate to no more than 20% -40% tax cut for small businesses
attorney general jeff sessions is testifying before the senate judiciary committee today, but he isn't revealing much. early on during the testimony sessions said, "i can neither assert executive privilege, nor can i disclose today the content of my confidential conversations with the president.” this came up again several times, including during this discussion with senator dianne feinstein where sessions was asked about james comey's firing, russia and joe arpaio's pardon. here's part of the exchange:  feinstein: "did the president ever mention to you his concern about lifting the cloud on the russia investigation?"   sessions: "senator feinstein, that calls for a communication that i've had with the president and i believe it remains confidential."  feinstein: "but you don't deny that there was a communication?"   sessions: "i do not confirm or deny the existence of any communication between the president that i consider to be confidential."
potential progress on a bipartisan healthcare deal. there is reportedly a plan in place that both donald trump and sen. chuck schumer may support. this is far from a done deal though.  the hill reports:  sen. lamar alexander (r-tenn.) said tuesday that he and sen. patty murray (d-wash.) have reached a bipartisan deal that would extend payments to insurers under obamacare that president trump said he was ending last week.   the deal would extend the payments to insurers for two years and give states more flexibility to change obamacare rules. the negotiations had been aimed at stabilizing insurance markets.
to not be outraged would be to normalize this president.  we’ve said it before and it needs to be repeated, as sure as the sun rises in the east, donald trump is going to lie.  and he did it again yesterday in spades. the occasion was a news conference with his new best friend-longtime enemy mitch mcconnell.  axios mike allen breaks down trump’s alternative reality.   —  •trump says he and mcconnell are "closer than ever before." both men and their staffs have been trashing each other in public and private for months.  •trump says other presidents "didn't make calls" to families of soldiers killed in duty. they did.  •trump says obamacare is "dead." his repeated efforts to repeal it failed.  •trump says it's been established that "no collusion" took place with the russians. bob mueller is interrogating the president's associates and advisers on this very point in real time.  •trump says he "already" has "the votes right now" for a bipartisan health care fix. he doesn't.  sound smart: the damnedest thing is that not a single bullet point i just wrote is disputable. while every one of those things the president said was.  why it matters: it's almost impossible for the media to cover these press conferences — or for republicans to discern what he wants and how he plans to get it — because trump spreads fake news while calling real news fake. this isn't new. and, yes, 35% of voters don't seem to care. but that doesn't make it any less dangerous.  yesterday's keepers:  •on gop senators: "i'm not going to blame myself, i'll be honest. they are not getting the job done."  •"obamacare is finished. it's dead. it's gone. it's no longer — you shouldn't even mention. it's gone. there is no such thing as obamacare anymore."  •on steve bannon's war on mcconnell and the republican establishment: "steve is ... a friend of mine ... i can understand where steve bannon is coming from. ... i know how he feels. ... there are some republicans, frankly, that should be ashamed of themselves."  •on whether he's considering firing mueller: "no, not at all."  •"oh, i hope hillary runs. is she going to run? i hope. hillary, please run again."  -p.s. bannon tells me by email: "mcconnell and the gop establishment have sown the wind — now be prepared the reap the whirlwind."

another gut-wrenching story from the california fires. a husband and wife huddling in a pool while fire surrounded them.  sfgate reports:  they held on through the long hours of the night, until the flames that had destroyed the house on the forested cul-de-sac finally began to recede, until the heat was no longer unbearable. and just before daybreak, just as the worst of the inferno had passed, carmen berriz stopped breathing. she died in the arms of her husband of 55 years.
"rather than being a commander in chief, he's like a hater in chief. he continues to tweet his hate all over the place, and rather than offering comforting words and being, you know, hey, if you can't be a president, be an executive. make sure that all ducks are straight in a row and you're getting things done."  that's what san juan mayor carmen yulín cruz said in reaction to donald trump's tweets that the government can't help puerto rico forever. cnn reported, "a gop source familiar with internal discussions told cnn that trump's tweets were a direct response to remarks that cruz had made earlier criticizing the president's response to hurricane maria." here's more of what cruz said in response to those reports. she sure isn't backing down.

as winds pick up again in northern california, the fires have now claimed 17 lives and destroyed at least 2000 homes and businesses.  why are the fires so particularly bad now? wired has a report titled "the napa fire is a perfectly normal apocalypse." here's an excerpt:  it has already been a fire season and a hurricane season that are, as researchers say, consistent with models of a changing climate.  cities are not immortal. economics and wars can kill them, but so can storms and fires. that’s especially true if cities aren’t built to resist—if cities are built in ways that make the change worse instead of fighting it.  so keep thinking about blame as northern california rebuilds—if regulations get brave enough to insist on denser cities, less flammable materials, different ornamental vegetation, underground power lines. the risk of fire will never be zero, but everyone knows what would knock a few points off. whether anyone will make those changes—well, the red wind makes people do crazy things.
former president barack obama has issued a statement against harvey weinstein, a man michelle obama once called a good friend. the statement reads:   “michelle and i have been disgusted by the recent reports about harvey weinstein. any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status. we should celebrate the courage of women who have come forward to tell these painful stories. and we all need to build a culture - including by empowering our girls and teaching our boys decency and respect - so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future.”  the obama’s daughter, malia, interned for weinstein earlier this year.
these pictures tell a heartbreaking story. they show what some businesses and homes looked like before the northern california fires and after. imagine something you worked so hard for, destroyed in just a matter of minutes.
if you didn't know what a bump stock was before the las vegas massacre, you most likely know what it is now. the device basically allows you to turn the speed of a semi-automatic weapon into that of a fully-automatic weapon. the reason why anyone would legally need to use one of these remains a mystery to most of us.   hopefully bump stocks won't be legal much longer. today as a bill was proposed in the house to ban bump stocks, a lawsuit was also filed.

donald trump’s accusations against the press are only making it more popular and trusted. from the latest reuters poll:   “every president clashes with the news media, but trump "has gone a step further in attacking the press and questioning their legitimacy," said martha kumar, a presidential historian who has worked with white house transition teams for obama and 2008 republican presidential nominee senator john mccain.  "what you're seeing now is a gradual recognition of the importance of the press" at a time when people are still getting used to a new president whose campaign is under federal investigation for alleged collusion with russia, kumar said. trump has denied any collusion occurred.”

"with all due respect, your thoughts and your prayers are insufficient. and by the way, the house of representatives will be voting on a piece of legislation this week. it's a bill to legalize the sale of silencers for guns. this is what they're working on. we have a major problem with gun violence in this country and i guess they don't care. if i'm wrong on that, fine, do something about it because i'm sick of it. and you know, i want this to be a comedy show. i hate talking about stuff like this. i just want to laugh about things every night, but that -- it seems to becoming increasingly difficult lately. it feels like someone has opened a window into hell. and what i'm talking about tonight isn't about gun control. it's about common sense. common sense says no good will ever come from allowing a person to have weapons that can take down 527 americans at a concert."
while so much attention has been focused on the man who carried out the biggest massacre in us history, we want to focus on the victims. the los angeles times has begun to compile the stories of those, at the concert, who were murdered.

donald trump took to twitter today to bash the mayor of san juan, carmen yulin cruz. this comes after she begged the president for more help. here's what trump said:  "the mayor of san juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the democrats that you must be nasty to trump. ...such poor leadership ability by the mayor of san juan, and others in puerto rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. they.......want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 federal workers now on island doing a fantastic job. the military and first responders, despite no electric, roads, phones etc., have done an amazing job. puerto rico was totally destroyed."  soon after trump made those statements, cruz tweeted "the goal is one: saving lives. this is the time to show our "true colors". we cannot be distracted by anything else."  nate silver from fivethirtyeight has a couple theories as to why trump is attacking cruz. he says:  “so, it totally fits the pattern that trump is attacking the mayor san juan. she challenged him and she's a woman (and hispanic, obviously.)"  “alternative hypothesis: trump has poor impulse control & is easily triggered, especially when being challenged (esp. by women & minorities).”  as for trump suggesting "they want everything to be done for them"...that again suggests puerto rico either isn't part of the us or is a welfare state. as the mayor said last night, in this interview on cnn, the community is doing everything they can possibly do and the mayor is doing this while sleeping in a shelter herself (her own home was destroyed). the citizens are desperate though for things like food, water and medicine...aid they desperately need from the us.

cnn contributor ana navarro tweeted: "things trump could do now to help 🇵🇷: waive jones act; put general in charge of fed response; airlift the frail; stop tweeting re damn nfl!"  so what is the jones act and why did the trump administration deny a request from several lawmakers to waive it? u.s. news and world report has details:  in his letter to lawmakers, mccain says he is "concerned" by the decision not to waive the restrictions and emergency waivers like this one are "valuable to speed up recovery efforts in the impacted regions" which is facing "a worsening humanitarian crisis following hurricane maria."  "it is unacceptable to force the people of puerto rico to pay at least twice as much for food, clean drinking water, supplies and infrastructure due to jones act requirements as they work to recover from this disaster," the senator wrote. "now, more than ever, it is time to realize the devastating effect of this policy and implement a full repeal of this archaic and burdensome act."  the restrictions placed on shipping are due to the merchant marine act of 1920, also known as the jones act. under the law, shipments between u.s. ports can be carried out only by vessels built and operated by americans. the government has occasionally waived these restrictions in emergencies...

donald trump has announced he's traveling to puerto rico.  the people on the island need lots of things more than a presidential visit, like electricity, food and water.  the situation in puerto rico is dire, and the white house is reacting a lot slower to this disaster than the ones that hit texas and florida.  via the washington post.  "house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-calif.) said the administration “must act immediately to make available additional department of defense resources for search-and-rescue operations, law enforcement and transportation needs.”  "the administration said monday that its response has been robust. the federal emergency management agency, which is coordinating the recovery effort, said 10,000 federal employees have been deployed to the caribbean. the coast guard has sent in 13 ships known as cutters. commercial barges are arriving with relief supplies. the national guard is being housed on barges and on a cruise ship that arrived this weekend.  "however, officials leading the response and recovery admit they’re facing serious logistical challenges, starting with damage to the ports and airports. many of those facilities have been reopened just within the past day or two, but only for daytime operations, because of safety concerns. radar and control tower capabilities are low, limiting the pace of incoming flights."
evacuations have been ordered and schools closed after a wildfire rapidly grows. the "canyon fire" is dangerously close to the 91 freeway, on the border between anaheim and corona.   cbs los angeles reports:  the canyon fire, which broke out about 1 p.m. monday, has forced the evacuation of about 300 homes and was only 5 percent contained as of 4:30 a.m. tuesday.  “it came up over the ridge there, probably 50-foot flames, sounded like a turbine engine when it came over, at times we were kind of thinking we probably should have left,” homeowner rick krumes said.
this is the definition of a dodge. during today's briefing white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders was asked several times whether it was appropriate for donald trump to call football players sobs. spoiler alert: she never actually answered the question.

donald trump turned a campaign rally for alabama senate candidate luther strange into a sales pitch for the wall along the mexican border. a wall he says, "we're spending a tremendous amount of money" on. trump told the crowd:  "the wall is happening. in fact, you probably saw, you know, we have a wall up there now, and we are renovating it already. it's being made pristine, perfect, just as good as new, though we may go a little higher than that, but that's okay. and we are building samples of a new wall. you know, it has to be a see-through wall."  here's more of why trump says he wants the wall to be see-through.
mccain's full statement:
former president barack obama spoke today about the republicans push to repeal the affordable care act. at an event for the bill & melinda gates foundation, he said:   "for the first time more than 90% of americans know the security of health insurance. paying more for insurance or being denied insurance because of a pre-existing condition or because you are a woman, that is not a thing anymore, we got rid of that. and people are alive today because of it and that is progress.   now, the legislation that we passed was full of things that still need to be fixed. it wasn't perfect. it was better.   and so when i see people trying to undo that hard won progress for the 50th or 60th time with bills that would raise cost or reduce coverage or rollback protections for older americans or people with pre-existing conditions, the cancer survivor, the expectant mom or the child with autism or asthma, for whom coverage once again would be almost unattainable, it is aggravating. and all of this being done without demonstrable or actuarial or plain common sense rational, it frustrates and it is certainly frustrating to have to mobilize every couple months to keep our leaders from inflicting real human suffering on our constituents."
puerto rico is assessing the devastation left behind after hurricane maria. there is reportedly severe damage to infrastructure and the entire island is in the dark.   the weather channel reports:  the director of the state agency for emergency management and disaster management, abner gómez, said that 100 percent of the subscribers of the island's electric energy authority are affected, primera hora reports.   "when we can get outside - we will find our island destroyed," gómez said. " the information we received is not encouraging. it's a system that has destroyed everything it has had in its wake."
wondering how the latest healthcare bill will impact... -people under 26  -adults under 65 -people with pre-existing medical conditions -people who go to planned parenthood -people who use mental health services  npr has a chart that explains the proposed changes for each group. here's an excerpt from their report:   it wasn't that long ago that the effort to repeal and replace the affordable care act died once and for all in the senate.  or so many thought.  but like the killer robot in the terminator or the undead fighters in game of thrones, the repeal effort has risen once again from the ashes in the form of a bill known as cassidy-graham. the bill, introduced sept. 13 by sens. bill cassidy, r-la., and lindsey graham, r-s.c., with little hope of going anywhere has gained steam in its short life and now looks like it may actually come to a vote in the senate in the coming days.  many opponents say the bill will result in millions of people losing their insurance coverage.

"the bbc understands cctv images have been obtained of the person suspected of planting the explosive device. the islamic state group has said it was behind the bomb, which detonated at 08:20 bst on friday.  it is understood the device had a timer, but the bbc's security correspondent frank gardner said the bomb appeared not to have gone off properly.  had it worked as intended, it would have killed everyone around it and maimed everyone in the train carriage for life, he said."
something new tonight from news and guts:  in the coming weeks and months we plan to bring you more original productions like this.  dan rather believes there are so many great stories that need to be covered, many of which aren’t getting the attention they deserve. this is one of those stories.  president trump slashed the number of refugees allowed to enter the u.s. each year in half and he’s trying to reduce the number even more. this comes at a time when there are more displaced people in the world than ever before. hundreds of thousands of these refugees are orphans. only a handful will be given a shot at coming to the united states where courageous americans have trained for months to become their foster parents.  note: thanks to lutheran social services of the national capital area for their help with this important story.

looks like donald trump can't help himself. just when you think his controversial charlottesville comments may be in his rear view, he decides to double down. today he said:  "i think especially in light of the advent of antifa, if you look at what's going on there, you have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also, and essentially that's what i said. now because of what's happening since then with that antifa, you look at really what's happened since charlottesville, a lot of people are saying in fact, a lot of people have actually written, gee, trump might have a point. i said, you've got some very bad people on the other side also, which is true."
seems facebook still has some work to do. from propublica:  "until this week, when we asked facebook about it, the world’s largest social network enabled advertisers to direct their pitches to the news feeds of almost 2,300 people who expressed interest in the topics of “jew hater,” “how to burn jews,” or, “history of ‘why jews ruin the world.’”  "to test if these ad categories were real, we paid $30 to target those groups with three “promoted posts” — in which a propublica article or post was displayed in their news feeds. facebook approved all three ads within 15 minutes."
house minority leader nancy pelosi and senator chuck schumer are talking about the "deal" they may be striking with the president in regards to #daca.  there is lots of confusion today about what may be in this deal, but from what the democratic leaders say, it seems like dreamers are protected and the wall isn't happening yet.
"heart of texas" was a facebook page that had more than 200,000 followers, was anti-clinton, anti-immigrant and anti-muslim.  it was also the work of russians. facebook hasn't been very forthcoming so far about exactly how russians used its platform but business insider reports the "heart of texas" page was a prime example of election influence.   "several signs pointed to the page being a russian influence operation, including a lack of contact information and ads, and a corresponding twitter account created in november 2015 - right around the time facebook experienced a surge in russia-linked, fake accounts, michel said. its "about" section read only: "texas's the land protected by lord."  "perhaps the most revealing clue that heart of texas was not a project spearheaded by dissatisfied texans was the language. the memes posted in the group contained typos, grammatical errors, and a general unfamiliarity with basic english phrases."
the drain in the swamp is now officially closed. politico is reporting tonight the office of government ethics has reversed itself and decided it's ok for lobbyists to donate to white house staffers who have legal defense funds, i.e. those who have lawyered up for mueller & co.
we learned recently of russia buying political ads on facebook. but you knew it was worse than that. now the daily beast reports russian operatives used facebook's event manager to remotely organize anti-immigrant and anti-muslim rallies during the 2016 presidential campaign.   "the facebook events—one of which echoed islamophobic conspiracy theories pushed by pro-trump media outlets—are the first indication that the kremlin’s attempts to shape america’s political discourse moved beyond fake news and led unwitting americans into specific real-life action.  “this is the next step,” clint watts, a former fbi agent and expert on russia’s influence campaign, told the daily beast. “the objective of influence is to create behavior change. the simplest behavior is to have someone disseminate propaganda that russia created and seeded. the second part of behavior influence is when you can get people to physically do something.”
your morning metaphor is brought to you by the washington post. where, oh where is donald trump? portraits of the president are customarily hung in federal buildings across the country, but the normally camera-loving trump is nowhere to be seen, 9 months after inauguration.   "the missing pictures might seem to be a minor matter in an administration consumed with hurricane relief, the north korean nuclear threat, an investigation into trump campaign contacts with russians, illegal immigration and other issues. �"yet to some, the absence of the ubiquitous official photos is puzzling, considering the chief executive’s fame was propelled by reality television and he has never been reluctant to promote his image. some agencies have been so determined to show the president’s photograph that they’ve improvised, downloading a scowling — and some say unflattering — photo of trump posted on the white house website."
hurricane irma brings major flooding to charleston.
today homeland security advisor tom bossert was asked about whether he thought all the hurricanes this year correlate at all with climate change.  here's what he had to say.
update from our news & guts correspondent cindi avila, reporting from south miami:  when the winds finally calmed down a bit, we ventured out to go to a home that has power (thanks to a generator).   the landscape is unrecognizable. a drive that normally takes 5 minutes took 25. uprooted and snapped trees litter the streets, some fences down. the good news is that we didn't witness any major structural damage and no real flooding.   we believe the strongest winds we were hit with were about 100 mph. just a few days ago we expected 150 mph+ winds.   it's eerie outside, but we know things could have been so much worse.
updates from our miami correspondent.
another video update from reporter in south miami. winds getting stronger by the hour.
to deny climate change at this point is a joke.  it grabs attention and boosts ratings but to what end?  we have this image of rush limbaugh fleeing florida all the while preaching to his devoted flock that the storm chasing him from the state is part of a liberal agenda. the west is burning. the south is flooding and more is on the way.  those non-believers may soon be burying more than their heads in the sand. via vox.
from our reporter in south miami:  winds are whipping up now with a steady stream of rain. most people we know lost power overnight. some people got messages power was being turned off on purpose, in some areas, so crews could work on power lines. cell service is spotty at best. i had no service all night, now i'm lucky to have one bar to get this video out.  our screen is partially down and several trees have toppled. the story is the same with a lot of other people we know here. lots of minor damage, but none to significant. we live about a mile from the water, but are hearing the threat of major storm surge is lessening as the storm continues moving west.   we stepped out during a safe moment to shoot this video and will try to send more when we feel it's safe.   we know the worst is still to come, but still thankful we aren't getting the brunt of the storm.  thinking about our southern neighbors in the keys, who we know are not as lucky as us.
an update on the end of daca.  during the white house briefing sarah huckabee sanders was asked to clarify this tweet that came from the president yesterday:  "for all of those (daca) that are concerned about your status during the 6 month period, you have nothing to worry about - no action!"  today huckabee said:  "during this six-month time, there are no changes that are being made to the program. at this point. after that, again, the goal is that congress makes a permanent fix and that congress actually does their job and that we have responsible immigration reform that takes place over these six months and those individuals won't be affected because they stepped up and did what they were asked to do by the american people."
ivanka trump's presence at a key meeting yesterday seems like it didn't sit well with lawmakers.  the new york times reports:  "mr. trump often invites his daughter ivanka trump into meetings to signal their conclusion — or to keep his interlocutors off balance. when ms. trump entered the office toward the end of the discussion on wednesday, ostensibly to discuss tax reform, republicans in the room reacted with astonishment and annoyance.  mr. mcconnell, who is barely on speaking terms with the president, quietly seethed, according to two people familiar with the situation."  the week has more.

speaker of the house paul ryan announces his support of donald trump's decision to end daca, with a six-month delay, saying:  "president trump was right in his decision. he made the right call. i'm encouraged by the fact that he gave us time to work out a consensus, to find a compromise."
attorney general jeff sessions officially announces that the administration is going to rescind daca saying:  "the department of justice has advised the president and the department of homeland security that the department of homeland security should begin an orderly, lawful wind-down, including the cancellation of memo that authorized this program.   acting secretary duke has chosen appropriately to initiate a wind-down process. this will enable the department of homeland security to conduct an orderly change."  "this is not a little matter. ending the previous administration's disrespect for the legislative process is an important first step. all immigration policies should serve the interests of the people of the united states. lawful immigrant and native-born alike."
we receive so many wonderful notes from our followers. with all the news we haven't published as many as we should have.  but here is a good one from lynne in oregon, along with dan's response.  thanks lynne! _______________________  dan, i really need some of your grandma’s wise words this morning. i need some mister rogers, i need some lincoln, carter and obama, some elie wiesel and albert schweitzer, and the gospels and the torah. i’m calling them all in today.  the west coast is burning, the gulf digging out from historic flooding, and the east preparing for hurricane irma. we are on the third week of smoke so thick in southern oregon from the 15 or more fires surrounding us that haze obscures the mountains and if you go outside, you wear a dust mask. every day, multiple time a day, this administration is dismantling our great country brick by brick, and now, we stand at the brink of nuclear conflict. everything good thing i thought our country believed in or supported is being disassembled, shut down, or rolled back without caution and often without learned or experienced input. i am exhausted and at times dispirited, but i stand ready to support and rebuilt this country i love so much.  to all our legislators, to general counsel mueller and his team, and to our friends and allies across the globe--we need your help and we need it now. be brave, have integrity, do what’s right for the future of our great nation, and in doing so, honor those who gave their lives defending it. this isn’t about party, it isn’t about anger or vendettas, it’s about setting a course for our future and defining and defending the foundations of what our country was built upon.  it must be done together.  i know what my grandpa, a proud american and illinois farm boy would say—stand up and be counted. be courageous, be of good faith, help your neighbor, humbly contribute your time, energy and talents toward the common good, and find beauty in the fine things that still remain. ____________________ from dan---thanks for your note, lynne. that was beautifully written.  at a time when there is so much talk of what divides us, we know what unites us--as americans, as a people. it is caring about one another and caring, deeply caring, about our country. i have lived long enough to have seen worse, much worse than we have today.  i have no doubt that we will prevail. i hope you had time to enjoy the holiday with your family and friends.  --dan.
for the many of you who often ask, "what the hell is taking so long?", we present you with this piece from politico which states the many russia investigations by congress are about to "kick into high gear."  really?  why has it been in low gear?   from politico:  "the return of the congressional russia probes also means the return of a phenomenon that has reportedly enraged trump and caused him to lash out at gop leaders: constant headlines about the latest incremental developments in these sprawling and unwieldy investigations.  there will be the daily, sometimes hourly, leaks about new witnesses, new lines of inquiry. there will be ominous cable news footage of lawmakers and witnesses disappearing into classified briefing rooms. and there will be grandstanding and bickering among members of congress in both parties, many of them trying to capitalize on the russia investigations to further their own political ambitions."
former president barack obama has largely avoided criticizing donald trump since he took over the oval office. that could change if trump ends daca tomorrow, as expected.  politico reports:  obama’s current plan is to post a statement on facebook and link to it on twitter, where the former president has more than 94 million followers. in his final presidential press availability, he suggested that he would speak out if trump went after the dreamers — and that it was one of the few issues where he would feel morally compelled to do so. he said he would not remain silent in the face of “efforts to round up kids who have grown up here and for all practical purposes are american kids, and send them someplace else, when they love this country.”
looks like donald trump is losing another employee. this times it's aid keith schiller, a man who had been with trump since 1999...formerly as his body guard.  the hill reports:  "schiller has reportedly said he plans to leave the white house at the end of september or in early october and cited financial reasons as his reason for the move.  the longtime trump aide reportedly wasn't pleased with new white house chief of staff john kelly and his newly implemented restrictions on access to the president."
hurricane harvey is to blame for a big rise in gas prices. some states are paying up to 29 cents more per gallon than they did just a week ago.
a comment from vice president mike pence is perhaps not getting as much attention as it should.  we know donald trump has been adamant that he will have a border wall built between mexico and the us. recently he even threatened to shutdown the government if congress didn't allocate funds to build it.   now with texas facing one of the worst storms in history, you would think that plan would be on the back burner and certainly a government shutdown would no longer be an option. think again. thursday the vp told abc's jon karl that "the president's made it clear that we're going to stand firm" and basically do what has to be done to get the wall built. it looks like that could even come at the expense of storm victims.
lots of conflicting information coming out after a fire at a chemical plant in crosby, texas.  here's what we know: a neighborhood has been evacuated and 15 police officers sent to the hospital after responding to the fire. the fire was reportedly a result of chemicals being left unrefrigerated after the plant lost power as a result of flooding caused by hurricane harvey.   there were reports of explosions at the plant, but a representative from the fire marshal's office was hesitant to call it an explosion, saying, "we heard some popping noise coming from that area. then, grey smoke and then followed by a fire."  most of the officers who were overcome by the fumes at the plant have since been released from the hospital. in the meantime, a 1.5 mile radius around the plant has been evacuated to ensure residents in the area don't get sick.   an executive from the company that owns the plant says they expect more fires to erupt at the plant. at a news conference this morning reporters also questioned him on the danger posed from the chemicals at the plant. there was clear confusion among officials about the potential health risks.
"what you've seen on the television screen, hour after hour, are examples of duty, honor, bravery. police officer perez trying to get to work, drowned. this has been, i think, the optics out of houston with the mayor, mayor turner, and the police chief acevedo, has been about that duty, honor, bravery.  when president trump came (to texas), the question is whether he could pick up on that, communicate that in some way.   now, i'm not here to judge whether he did or didn't. each person will have to judge for themselves, but i think there's a very serious case to be made that although the president went, give him credit for that, didn't make any big mistakes, but he sort of came and went and ran the risk of seeming irrelevant. this is part of the problem he's having with his presidency, whether he is all show and no go. or as they would say in texas, all hat and no cattle, because he can't deliver."  -dan rather on msnbc with chris hayes  -august 30, 2017
next time someone uses the word fake news or say reporters are the enemy, remind them of the unbelievable work correspondents are doing in texas right now. in some cases it's even life-saving work. that was the case today as cnn reporter drew griffin rescued a man, from a submerged car, just seconds before a live shot. take a look.
it's now confirmed, a 34-year veteran with the houston police department died as a result of the storm. sgt. steve perez passed away sunday while trying his best to get to work, to help others.   houston police chief art acevedo said sgt. perez drove for about two and a half hours trying to find a safe way to his station.    here chief acevedo talks about notifying perez's wife and how the officer died.
nbc news is reporting robert mueller is "keenly focused" on the response donald trump dictated about his son's now infamous meeting with a russian lawyer.   "the sources told nbc news that prosecutors want to know what trump knew about the meeting and whether he sought to conceal its purpose."
president trump addressed his pardon of former arizona sheriff joe arpaio in a news conference today. when asked why he issued the pardon, while a catastrophic hurricane was hitting texas, he said he did it for the ratings! he then went on to make arpaio out to be somewhat of a hero, not a criminal. here's a little of what he said:  "i assumed the ratings would be far higher than they were normally. the hurricane was just starting and i put out that i pardoned, as we call sheriff joe. he's done a great job for the people of arizona. he's very strong on borders, very strong on illegal immigration. he is loved in arizona."
we love smart journalism and the folks at npr give us great work day after day. this story is a perfect example. scientists say climate change is at least partly to blame for hurricane harvey because the water temp in the gulf of mexico is warmer.   from npr:  "this year saw high sea surface temperatures in the gulf of mexico, where harvey formed. according to an analysis published in march, the gulf stayed above 73 degrees fahrenheit the entire winter.  "at the time harvey intensified into a category 4 hurricane, it was over a section of the gulf that was about four degrees above normal, says martin hoerling, a research meteorologist with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in boulder, colo.  "the water in the gulf of mexico is the heat reservoir to support these hurricanes," says ben kirtman, an atmospheric scientist at the university of miami. the warm water and air above the gulf means there's more energy to drive a storm such as hurricane harvey."
breaking: from the washington post. donald trump asked attorney general jeff sessions if the government could drop the case against joe arpaio, months before the ex-sheriff's case went to trial.   "the president asked attorney general jeff sessions whether it would be possible for the government to drop the criminal case against arpaio, but was advised that would be inappropriate, according to three people with knowledge of the conversation.  "after talking with sessions, trump decided to let the case go to trial, and if arpaio was convicted, he could grant clemency."
justice was not done. joe arpaio was yet to be sentenced for his crime. but that didn't matter to donald trump as he pushed a shiv through the heart of the american justice system.  as senator john mccain wrote,  "the president has the authority to make this pardon, but doing so at this time undermines his claim for the respect of rule of law..". trump also thumbed his nose at his own justice department because there was no pardon review process, common in such matters.   but most important was the precedent this pardon set.  think russia. here's a must read from michael waldman, president of the brennan center for justice at nyu school of law, via new york daily news.
donald trump signed an executive order imposing economic sanctions against venezuela. as part of the order, u.s. banks will be prevented from conducting any new financial deals with the venezuelan government or their state-run oil company.  treasury secretary steven mnuchin explained what this means in today's white house briefing.
with a major hurricane about to hit the u.s., many of you have asked us whether there is a fema director in place. the answer is yes. brock long was appointed by donald trump in april and confirmed in june. the reason you may not have heard much about him is because there really wasn't any controversy surrounding his appointment.  eli lehrer, head of the r street institute, a research group that promotes climate change solutions told bloomberg:  "he is a rare trump appointee who is a well-known professional in the field in which he was appointed... every part of his reputation suggests he’ll take a careful, deliberate, technocratic approach to the job."  long's resume includes a past stint as hurricane program manager at fema and he also headed up alabama's emergency management agency.  as he faces his first challenge on the job, long shared this update with good morning america.
good morning. dan has been monitoring hurricane harvey and has an update: __________________  the longer i go the more i know that i really don’t know much about anything. but i do know something about hurricanes, having been raised on the texas coast, experienced numerous ones growing up, lived  with  family members who had experienced dozens of them, and then professionally covering many hurricanes as a kind of specialty. doesn’t make me an expert on them, but may make me knowledgeable enough to say about current hurricane harvey now threatening the texas coast: beware, be very beware of this one. all indications are that it may—may—be really bad. not “just another” hurricane that blows in and is over quickly. it has the potential to be particularly disastrous—possibly even catastrophic— in some areas.  here’s why:   —-harvey is now a category 2 (on a 5 scale), but predictions are it will be a 3 by the time it hits sometime late tomorrow or saturday. and it has the potential to go to a category 4, or something near that. this would mean an unusually high “sea surge” (used to be called a “tidal wave”) and very high tides before and during landfall.         at even in the lower categories, winds could be 115-125 mph…with a category 3, 145mph or so. and such winds—together with the tornadoes they often spawn off to the side— can be killers. but, rising water is at least as great, or greater, a danger.     —-this one has the characteristics of a storm that moves slowly once over land; the kind that sometimes hits and then “sits” for awhile. the could mean rainfall of 25 inches or more in some areas, and very heavy sustained rain over a very wide area stretching roughly from southwest louisiana to northeast mexico. and when it does move farther inland it may be potent deeper, longer inland than more common hurricanes. for example, san antonio and other areas away from the coast might suffer more than people expect.   —right now, a section of the coast running roughly from just below corpus christi to just south of houston and galveston is the guess at where the storm’s main force will come in.  but this is—even for a hurricane—a wild child, its course especially hard to predict.  predicting hurricane paths is always difficult, extra so with this one.     given its make up, this hurricane may affect more people and property, and be in the news longer than most.   let’s hope it doesn’t turn out as powerful as it now appears. but that’s not the way to bet it.   --dan
most of the first white house briefing in three weeks focused on the mexican border wall. donald trump recently changed his tune on the issue. he had said countless times that mexico was going to pay for a wall. then all the sudden, this week, he seems to have made a shift. he is now threatening a government shutdown if congress doesn't fund the wall. if you are confused, you aren't the only one. this left countless reporters at today's briefing scratching their heads.  here's one of the exchanges.

wondering who the man was holding up the sign behind donald trump last night that said "blacks for trump"?  chicago tribune reports:  "the radical fringe activist from miami once belonged to a violent black supremacist religious cult and he runs a handful of amateur, unintelligible conspiracy websites. he has called barack obama "the beast" and hillary clinton a ku klux klan member. oprah, he says, is the devil.  most curiously, in the 1990s, he was charged, then acquitted, with conspiracy to commit two murders.  but michael the black man loves president donald trump. and president trump's campaign apparently loves him right back."
in this exclusive msnbc morning joe excerpt from hillary clinton's upcoming book "what happened," clinton talks about the debate where donald trump stood right behind her while she was answering debate questions. clinton says:  "it was the second presidential debate, and donald trump was looming behind me. two days before the world heard him brag about groping women. now we were on a small stage and no matter where i walked, he followed me closely, staring at me, making faces. it was incredibly uncomfortable. he was literally breathing down my neck. my skin crawled.   it was one of those moments where you wish you could hit pause and ask everyone watching, well, what would you do? do you stay calm, keep smiling and carry on as if he weren't repeatedly invading your space? or do you turn, look him in the eye, and say loudly and clearly, back up, you creep. get away from me. i know you love to intimidate women, but you can't intimidate me, so back up."   http://amzn.to/2w2ri9y
the former director of national intelligence, james clapper, tells cnn he questions donald trump's fitness for office after a rant-filled rally last night in arizona.   "clapper denounced trump's "behavior and divisiveness and complete intellectual, moral and ethical void."  "how much longer does the country have to, to borrow a phrase, endure this nightmare?"
for the first time we are hearing part of hillary clinton's new book, "what happened." in this exclusive from msnbc's morning joe, clinton says:  "writing this wasn't easy. every day that i was a candidate for president, i knew that millions of people were counting on me, and i couldn't bear the idea of letting them down, but i did.   i couldn't get the job done, and i'll have to live with that for the rest of my life."  http://amzn.to/2xcxrvn
instead of sharing a clip from donald trump's rally in phoenix, we want to share don lemon's reaction on cnn, immediately following the speech. lemon said:  "i'm just going to speak from the heart here. what we witnessed is a total eclipse of the facts. someone who came out on stage and lied directly the american people and left things out that he said in an attempt to rewrite history, especially when it comes to charlottesville. he's unhinged, it's embarrassing and i don't mean for us, the media because he went after us, but for the country. this is who we elected president of the united states. a man who is so petty that he has to go after people he deems to be his enemy, like an imaginary friend of a 6-year-old. his speech was without thought, without reason, devoid of facts, devoid of wisdom."  take a look at more of what lemon and cnn political director david chalian said about the president's mental state.
at his phoenix rally donald trump hints he will pardon joe arpaio, but just didn't want to do it tonight. he said:  "was sheriff joe convicted for doing his job? he should have had a jury, but you know what? i'll make a prediction. i think he's going to be just fine. okay?"  then after the crowd chanted "pardon, pardon." trump followed up with:   "but i won't do it tonight because i don't want to cause any controversy is that okay? alright. but sheriff joe should feel good."  arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt charges and will be sentenced october 5th. he could face up to six months in jail.
if you are looking for house speaker paul ryan to strongly condemn the president's response to charlottesville think again. during a cnn town hall monday night, ryan said we all need to do better in condemning hate, not just donald trump.   and while he called the president's comments after charlottesville's "morally ambiguous," he says that trump has since done better. we aren't exactly sure what he is referring to, but ryan seemed to infer last night's speech on afghanistan helped trump smooth things over. ryan said, "i'm pleased with the things he just said tonight, to add clarity to the confusion that i think he gave us on tuesday."  here's what he said when asked whether congress should censure the president.
these are some great photos sent in by news & guts readers. we love all the photos! some absolutely took our breath away.
minnesota congressman keith ellison has been one of the most vocal critics of the president's statements following charlottesville. last week ellison said "the reason he (trump) is reluctant to denounce white supremacy and neo-nazis and klan members is because he has some level of sympathy for them."  today ellison appeared on cnn to clarify what he meant.
10 sailors are missing and five injured after the uss mccain collides with a tanker.  reuters reports:  ten sailors are missing after a u.s. warship collided with an oil tanker east of singapore before dawn on monday, tearing a hole beneath the waterline and flooding compartments that include a crew sleeping area, the u.s. navy said.  the collision between the guided-missile destroyer uss john s. mccain and the tanker alnic mc was the second involving a u.s. navy destroyer and a merchant vessels in asian waters in little more than two months.  the ships collided while the u.s. warship was heading to singapore for a routine port call, the navy said in a statement.

treasury secretary steven mnuchin responds to yale classmates who urged him to resign.   reuters reports:  mnuchin, who is jewish, added: "while i find it hard to believe i should have to defend myself on this, or the president, i feel compelled to let you know that the president in no way, shape or form, believes that neo-nazi and other hate groups who endorse violence are equivalent to groups that demonstrate in peaceful and lawful ways."  ultimately, he said, his classmates should be comforted by his remaining in the administration.  "i don't believe the allegations against the president are accurate, and i believe that having highly talented men and women in our country surrounding the president in his administration should be reassuring to you and all the american people," he said.
a violent night for police officers in three different u.s. cities.  in kissimmee, fl one officer was killed and the police chief says it's not looking good for a second officer who was shot, "it's grave. not much hope that he will survive this."  officers were also shot in jacksonville, fl and fairchance, pa.
this sure didn't take long... the white house correspondent for breitbart announces that steve bannon has returned to the website. in a series of tweets he said:  "🚨siren🚨 steve bannon returned to breitbart news as executive chairman of breitbart news and chaired our evening editorial meeting  “breitbart’s pace of global expansion will only accelerate with steve back. the sky’s the limit.”  - breitbart ceo larry solav"
the remaining members of the president's commission on arts and humanities have resigned in protest over donald trump's comments on charlottesville.   from the washington post:  "members of the president’s committee are drawn from broadway, hollywood, and the broader arts and entertainment community and said in a letter to trump that “your words and actions push us all further away from the freedoms we are guaranteed.”  “reproach and censure in the strongest possible terms are necessary following your support of the hate groups and terrorists who killed and injured fellow americans in charlottesville,” the commissioners wrote in a letter sent to the white house on friday morning. “the false equivalencies you push cannot stand. the administration’s refusal to quickly and unequivocally condemn the cancer of hatred only further emboldens those who wish america ill. we cannot sit idly by, the way that your west wing advisors have, without speaking out against your words and actions.”
did cnn's don lemon ban former republican congressman jack kingston from coming back to his show on live tv? it sure looked like that might be the case last night after kingston turned a conversation about trump supporters abandoning ship, to a talking point about hillary clinton starting the birther movement. a story that lemon pointed out has been debunked time and again.  take a look.
heather heyer's mother has a message for the president today, "think before you speak."  susan bro told good morning america's robin roberts that, "i have not and now i will not" speak to donald trump.
yet another presidential council is abandoned, even before it's formed. via bloomberg.
you should make a habit of reading mike allen at axios. if you haven't heard of him, allen wrote the must-read "playbook" column at politico before co-founding axios. he was once called "the man the white house wakes up to."  here's part of today's newsletter: __________________  trump's 7 months of self-destruction:  president trump, with at least two years of full republican control of government at the national and state levels, has systematically damaged or destroyed his relationship with — well, almost every group or individual essential to success.  this has left him on an island inhabited by a shrinking band of true-believer voters, who can help win an election, but can do nothing to help him exploit the power he's wasting:  yesterday's mass exodus of ceos from his outside business councils was an unusually abrupt sign of the 210 days of rot and erosion in his support. a vivid demonstration of the sudden abandonment of trump, via cnn's brian stelter: shep smith said he couldn't get a single republican to go on fox news to defend trump. on msnbc, chuck todd said he "invited every single republican senator on this program tonight, all 52," plus a dozen house gopers. none would do it. on cnn, kate bolduan said bookers called 55 republicans, and only one said yes.  why it matters: trump's undisciplined and incendiary style has left the most powerful man in the world with few friends — not one in the united states senate, for instance.  trump started with a pretty clean slate but has methodically alienated:  the public: gallup has his approval at 34%, down from 46% just after the inauguration. republican congressional leaders — senate majority mitch mcconnell in particular. every democrat who could help him do a deal. the media. ceos. world leaders. europe. muslims. hispanics. african americans. military leaders. the intelligence community. his own staff.  and who's happy?  steve bannon. saudi arabia. breitbart. david duke.  be smart: the presidency is a lonely job. but trump is unusually isolated because he thinks he needs no one besides himself. as one of his most ardent defenders told me: "he's just not as good as he thinks he is. and no one can tell him."
"there's considerable evidence that there's a consensus developing in the military, at the highest levels, in the intelligence community, among republicans in congress, including the leaders in the business community that the president of the united states, donald trump, is unfit to be the president of the united states. that's the undercurrent.   i've talked to you about it for weeks, that i've been hearing in washington. there is increasing talk about his emotional and mental stability. as david gergen referred to earlier, this is extraordinary. it's a dangerous moment in our history."  -carl bernstein, investigative journalist on cnn  august 17, 2017
after four ceos quit, it now looks like donald trump's council of business leaders is close to disbanding. from the new york times:  update: the councils have officially disbanded
here's the moment donald trump seemed to place more blame on the counter-protestors than those on the alt-right. the reason? the alt-right people had a permit, the counter-protestors did not. here's what he said:  "there were people protesting very quietly the taking down the statue of robert e. lee. i am sure there were some bad ones. the following day, it looked like they had some rough, bad people, neo-nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them. you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest and very legally protest. i don't know if you know, they had a permit. the other group didn't have a permit. so i only tell you this, there are two sides to a story."
here's a look at some of president trump's stunning news conference today:  "what about the alt left that came charging at, as you say, at the alt right? do they have any a semblance of guilt? what about the fact that they came charging with clubs in their hands swinging clubs? do they have any problem? i think they do. that was a horrible, horrible day. wait a minute. i'm not finished. i'm not finished, fake news."   "you had a group on one side that was bad. you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. and nobody wants to say that. i'll say it right now. you had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit and they were very, very violent."  "not all of those people were neo-nazis, believe me. not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch. those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue, robert e. lee."
unbelievable.   we will post clips soon.
in a bizarre and contentious news conference, the president compared the alt-right to what he now calls the "alt-left" (meaning protestors on the other side). when reporters challenged him on it, he said the alt-left should be partially blamed  for what happened in charlottesville, but said "nobody wants to say that."  trump went on to say some people protesting the removal of the robert e. lee statue were peaceful and had a permit, but the other side didn't have a permit.  clips coming...
the idea of running over protesters with cars has, according to slate.com, "long been a right wing fantasy since the dawn of the black lives matter movement."    here's an instructional video from the daily caller -- founded by tucker carlson--that was reposted by fox news that urges viewers to "study the technique."
most of us knew this, the speech yesterday condemning hate groups wasn't the president's idea. while he spoke the words k.k.k., neo-nazis and white supremacists slate.com reports "the only thing is: trump didn’t want to."  "several of trump’s senior advisers, including new chief of staff john kelly, had urged him to make a more specific condemnation, warning that the negative story would not go away and that the rising tide of criticism from fellow republicans on capitol hill could endanger his legislative agenda, according to two white house officials."
a north dakota man says his son is no longer welcome in his home after finding out he participated in the hateful march in charlottesville.  in a letter published on a local news site the father says:  "i have shared my home and hearth with friends and acquaintances of every race, gender and creed. i have taught all of my children that all men and women are created equal. that we must love each other all the same.  evidently, peter has chosen to unlearn these lessons, much to my and his family’s heartbreak and distress. we have been silent up until now, but now we see that this was a mistake. it was the silence of good people that allowed the nazis to flourish the first time around, and it is the silence of good people that is allowing them to flourish now.  peter tefft, my son, is not welcome at our family gatherings any longer. i pray my prodigal son will renounce his hateful beliefs and return home. then and only then will i lay out the feast."
heather heyer, the 32-year-old who was killed in charlottesville, died standing up for a cause she believed in. that's according to her friend and former co-worker marissa blair. today blair told cnn's chris cuomo:  "if you knew heather, you would know she loves everyone and wants equality for everyone, no matter who you love, what color you are. she was very strong in what she felt and she spoke with conviction. she would never back down from what she believed in. that's what she died doing, fighting for what she believed in."
if you serve in donald trump's cabinet it seems part of your job description must be to defend the president. today attorney general jeff sessions, who has been the president's punching bag this summer, made the rounds on morning tv. sessions was singing the president's praises, saying he thought the statement he made about charlottesville was good.
the mother of the 20-year-old ohio man charged with plowing down a woman in charlottesville, killing her and injuring several others, is speaking out today.   samantha bloom told the associated press that she just thought her son was going to attend a rally that "had something to do with trump." she says she had no idea it was actually related to white supremacy.
in his first interview since his 11-day-stint as white house communications director, anthony scaramucci talks to this week's george stephanopoulos about whether he thought the president should have given a stronger statement about charlottesville and why he calls the "bannon-bart (breitbart) influence...a snag on the president."
virginia governor terry mcauliffe delivers a strong message many say should have come from the president. mcauliffe addressed the nation, condemning specific racist groups. here's part of what he said:   "i have a message to all the white supremacists and the nazis who came into charlottesville today. our message is plain and simple. go home. you are not wanted in this great commonwealth. shame on you. you pretend that you're patriots, but you are anything but a patriot."   "you came here today to hurt people, and you did hurt people. but my message is clear, we are stronger than you. you have made our commonwealth stronger. you will not succeed. there is no place for you here, there is no place for you in america."   #charlottesville
the president has been criticized for not coming out and specifically condemning white supremacists for the violence over the last 24 hours in virginia. in case there is any question as to why this is important, new york times contributing writer anushay hossain, a uva alum, put it this way on cnn:   "i want to hear specifics from this president. the statement that he released...we could apply that to a situation anywhere. why isn't coming out against hate groups, against the klan? these are not just regular protesters, they are klan members without their hoods. why isn't he speaking about neofascism, neo-nazism?"  "we need a clear statement from our president that this kind of violence will not be tolerated, not for everyone. this is white supremacy, supremacists out in full force."
breaking now: several people are reportedly injured after a car (or cars) intentionally plows into a crowd of people peacefully marching in a counter-protest to the white nationalist rally in virginia.  a twitter user posted the attached video. we have to warn you, it is hard to watch.  here's more from the associated press:  authorities are on the scene after a vehicle plowed into a group of people marching peacefully through downtown charlottesville.  an associated press reporter saw at least one person on the ground receiving medical treatment immediately afterward the incident, which occurred approximately two hours after violent clashes between white nationalists and counter-protesters.  the nationalists were holding the rally to protest plans by the city of charlottesville to remove a statue of confederate gen. robert e. lee.  there were several hundred protesters marching in a long line when the car drove into a group of them.  https://t.co/muozs71pf4
the bs meter is pegging.  we feel like we need to preface everything donald trump says with 'seriously?' or 'can you believe?'  latest example: trump tells the governor of guam that his island's tourism is going to increase tenfold because north korea is threatening to attack it with nukes.   from the washington post:  "unprompted, trump then offered this assessment: “eddie, i have to tell you, you’ve become extremely famous. all over the world the world, they’re talking about guam, and they’re talking about you, and i think — tourism, i can say this, your tourism, you’re going to go up like tenfold with the expenditure of no money, so i congratulate you. … it just looks like a beautiful place.”
developing: president trump indicates it may be time for the us to intervene in venezuela saying:  "venezuela is a mess. it's very dangerous mess and a very sad situation."   "i'm not going to rule out a military option. we have many options for venezuela."  if this news takes you by surprise, you aren't the only one. cnn contributor ana navarro summed it up this way on twitter, "in case you've been away from tv for the last 30 minutes, trump now has us at brink of war w/north korea and venezuela. have a nice weekend."
more now from donald trump's q&a with reporters today. the president gave a rather flippant response when asked about vladimir putin's order to cut the number of us diplomats working in russia by as many as 755 people. trump said he was thankful that hundreds of people were losing their jobs:  "i want to thank him because we're trying to cut down on payroll and as far as i'm concerned i'm very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll. there's no real reason for them to go back, so i -- i greatly appreciate the fact that they have been able to cut our payroll for the united states. we'll save a lot of money."
it looks like there is a real war of words between donald trump and north korea. both are going back and forth with strong threats.  just before president trump spoke tonight, cnn reports that the north korea state agency released a statement saying:   "the us would suffer a shameful defeat and final doom if it persists in extreme military adventure, sanctions and pressure." the statement goes on to say that korean officials "vowed to mercilessly wipe out the provocateurs making desperate attempts to stifle the socialist country."  meanwhile shortly after that statement was released trump answered reporters' questions about a variety of topics including north korea. here's part of the news conference:   trump: "i read about where in guam by august 15th. let's see what he (kim jong-un) does with guam. if he does something in guam, it will be an event the likes of which nobody has seen before, what will happen in north korea."  reporter: "and when you say that, what do you mean?"  trump: "you'll see, you'll see, and he'll see. he will see."  reporter: "is that a dare?"  trump: "it's not a dare it's a statement."
in case there is any question about whether it's ever okay to invoke hitler here's a new case in point. cnn commentator jeffrey lord has been fired from the network after tweeting "sieg heil."
here it is, president trump doubling down on his tough talk against north korea saying his statement perhaps wasn't tough enough. a reporter responded by asking, "what would be tougher than fire and fury?"
donald trump says his earlier threat against north korea may not have been strong enough. developing via the washington post.
while so much attention is on military action against north korea, senator john mccain is putting some focus back on afghanistan, saying:  “nearly seven months into president trump’s administration, we’ve had no strategy at all as conditions on the ground have steadily worsened...the thousands of americans putting their lives on the line in afghanistan deserve better from their commander in chief.”
the morning news brings us word of a military strategy that begs the question:  do we really know what the hell we're doing?  the trump administration is considering  a bombing campaign against north korea involving long-range b-1's based in guam.  these bombers don't carry nukes and would be used to strike north korea's missile program.   from nbc news:  "pairs of b-1s have conducted 11 practice runs of a similar mission since the end of may, the last taking place on monday. the training has accelerated since may, according to officials. in an actual mission, the non-nuclear bombers would be supported by satellites and drones and surrounded by fighter jets as well as aerial refueling and electronic warfare planes.  "of all the military options … [president trump] could consider, this would be one of the two or three that would at least have the possibility of not escalating the situation," said retired adm. james stavridis, former supreme allied commander europe and an nbc news analyst."
breaking: from the washington post--the fbi has raided the home of former trump campaign chairman paul manafort. the raid was conducted on july 26, the day after manafort testified before the senate intelligence committee.
dan rather talks to msnbc's chris hayes about the administration's push to crack down on leaks coming out of the white house:  "i can't remember an administration where you had this many leaks, this early in a presidency. with two-term presidents, and president nixon who didn't quite finish two terms, when you got to the worst of it in watergate, there would be leaks. but i don't think anyone in our history, certainly not in the history of the modern presidency, has this early been this many leaks.   now, one reading of that, it would be my own opinion, is that one reason you've had so many leaks is the white house itself has been chaos. one could say, dysfunctional if you will so that's one reason. the second is, i think that many people who are inside the administration are appalled by what they see going on on the inside and saying, for the good of the country, the public has to know this."  take a look at the clip for more on what dan said about the attorney general's announcement that he would pursue criminal charges against those caught leaking classified information.
here's the video of tillerson making his remarks.  tillerson is also defending the president's controversial comments about "fire and fury" against north korea telling reporters:  "i think what the president was doing is sending a strong message that kim jong un will understand. i think the president wanted to be clear to the north korean regime that the us has an unconditional ability to defend itself, will defend itself and its allies."
the washington post is reporting that "north korea has produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles."  here's more from the report:  north korea has successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles, crossing a key threshold on the path to becoming a full-fledged nuclear power, u.s. intelligence officials have concluded in a confidential assessment.  the new analysis completed last month by the defense intelligence agency comes on the heels of another intelligence assessment that sharply raises the official estimate for the total number of bombs in the communist country’s atomic arsenal. the u.s. calculated last month that up to 60 nuclear weapons are now controlled by north korean leader kim jong un. some independent experts believe the number of bombs is much smaller.  the findings are likely to deepen concerns about an evolving north korean military threat that appears to be advancing far more rapidly than many experts had predicted. u.s. officials last month concluded that pyongyang is also outpacing expectations in its effort to build an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking cities on the american mainland.
how many of your tax dollars are going into donald trump's pocket? that's what democrats want to find out. how much does the government spend at trump's for-profit properties? amazingly, the answer appears to be no one knows.  from cnbc:  "most presidents have maintained and visited their personal homes while in office. think george w. bush's crawford, texas, ranch and barack obama's chicago house.  "the difference with trump is that his residences are part of his business empire. that means when the state department and department of homeland security spend money to move and protect the president around his own properties, some taxpayer money makes its way into trump organization coffers."
"most people don't believe, up to now, he's been a good president. in fact, the image of it is that he's flaky as dough baked pie crusts...and besides that he's lazy. that's the perception that most people have. and until and unless he turns that around, he's going to have a presidency in trouble."  -dan rather on don lemon cnn (08/07/17)
ah, the saga of "nicole mincey." over the weekend, donald trump used twitter to thank nicole for her support. one problem. she doesn't exist. add to the strangeness of this presidency nicole and perhaps millions more like her; bots that seem to be real until you take a closer look.   from vogue:  "sadly, nicole mincey isn’t the only trump bot out there pushing pro-trump propaganda and merch. over the weekend, several twitter users pointed out a number of fake accounts that have all been using photos of t-shirt models in order to create fake personas online. one trump bot account (which has also been recently suspended) pulled a photo of a “trendy hispanic girl” (that is the actual search term) from apparel mock-up site placeit, which allows users to promote their t-shirt designs on models. the profile photo of “nicole mincey” was also pulled from that site, as were a number of other fake accounts featuring photos of primarily african-american and latino fans.

national security adviser h.r. mcmaster is talking about a potential missile attack from north korea saying, "whether it could reach san francisco or pittsburgh or washington. how much does that matter, right? it's a grave threat."  msnbc has more from mcmaster and an interesting debate on this very serious situation.
fallout from the failure of the gop healthcare bill continues. there was lots of talk last week about the no vote from republican senators susan collins and lisa murkowski. now the women talk to cnn's dana bash about whether the president tried to intimidate them and they also address a conversation they had with john mccain that they say will stick with them for years to come.
this is moving fast. cnn reports:  federal investigators exploring whether donald trump's campaign colluded with russian spies have seized on trump and his associates' financial ties to russia as one of the most fertile avenues for moving their probe forward, according to people familiar with the investigation.  the web of financial ties could offer a more concrete path toward potential prosecution than the broader and murkier questions of collusion in the 2016 campaign, these sources said.
a rather contentious exchange at the white house briefing today. president trump adviser stephen miller spoke about what the president called a "merit-based immigration system." under the plan the us would cut down on the number of immigrants coming in by 50% over the next decade. immigrants who speak english before entering the us and those who have special skills would be favored over low-skilled workers and those who only speak a foreign language.   when cnn's jim acosta asked miller about whether this plan goes against america values things got rather testy.  here's part of the exchange.
dow jones tops 22,000 for the first time and guess who's taking credit?    but donald trump sang a different tune before the election.  from the washington post:  "the problem is that before he was elected, he warned repeatedly that the stock market would crash as soon as the federal reserve began raising interest rates. in the aftermath of the great recession, the fed dramatically lowered rates to near zero — and kept them there for years. as he began running for president, trump darkly warned that rates were being kept artificially low to ensure hillary clinton’s election and that everything would tumble once rates began to creep up again.  "the fed did begin to raise rates — on dec. 17, 2015, dec. 15, 2016, march 16, 2017, and june 15, 2017. and yet the market has not plunged as trump predicted, but has continued to climb."

when reporters asked sarah huckabee sanders today about the credible report from the washington post that the president dictated donald jr.’s misleading statement on his meeting with a russian attorney she basically said nothing to see here, he's a dad and helped his son like any dad would, instead reporters should be investigating the clintons. fyi, trumps attorneys have in the past categorically denied the president helped draft the statement.  here's more of what sanders said:  "the only thing i see misleading is a years worth of stories that have been fueling a false narrative about this russian collusion, a phony scandal, based on anonymous sources. if we're going to talk about misleading, that's the only thing misleading i see in this entire process. you guys are focused on a meeting don jr. had, no consequence, when the democrats actually colluded with a foreign government like ukraine."  she goes on to say:   "if you want to talk further about a relationship with russia look no further than the clintons."
breaking: from the washington post--donald trump dictated a misleading statement about his son's meeting with a russian lawyer.   from the post:  "flying home from germany on july 8 aboard air force one, trump personally dictated a statement in which trump jr. said he and the russian lawyer had “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of russian children” when they met in june 2016, according to multiple people with knowledge of the deliberations. the statement, issued to the new york times as it prepared a story, emphasized that the subject of the meeting was not a campaign issue at the time. the claims were later shown to be misleading.  "as special counsel robert s. mueller iii investigates potential obstruction of justice as part of his broader probe of russian interference in the 2016 election, these advisers worry that the president’s direct involvement leaves him needlessly vulnerable to allegations of a coverup."

maybe john kelly should wait to order new furniture. as donald trump welcomes a new chief of staff to the white house (not to mention new press secretary, new director of communications, and someday soon new attorney general) it's best to remember the president's white house dress code--always wear something that would look good under a bus.  what industry leader or bright young talent would ever subject themselves to this workplace torture?  instead we get guys nicknamed "the mooch" who give us anatomy lessons.    ezra klein at vox once again hits the nail on the head.   "for trump, though, loyalty is a one-way street. he turns out to be precisely one of those guys who will stab a friend in the back as soon as the friend becomes a problem. and the problem for trump, and for the rest of us, is that the whole country is watching him do it."
white house is in "utter disarray." donald trump is "unfit to command, in my opinion."  douglas brinkley, presidential historian on cnn reliable sources
ah, the incredible shrinking airline seat. it's difficult to measure one's posterior, but if it was uncomfortably tight the last time you squeezed into economy, you're probably more than 17 inches across, cheek to cheek. that's the absurdly narrow width of many airline seats today.  and don't get us started on legroom.  31 inches is great if you have a plane full of 8-year-olds.  but as passengers grow larger and seats shrink, are cramped cabins a safety issue?  a federal appeals court rules yes. via bloomberg.
reince priebus entered the history books as the shortest serving (non-interim) chief-of-staff in history (189 days). from the outside, it seems like his final days or weeks on the job were rather rocky. that said, priebus sure doesn't seem to have any hard feelings about his departure from the white house. here's part of an interview he did with cnn's wolf blitzer...  priebus: i'm always going to be a trump fan. i'm on team trump, and i look forward to helping him achieve his goals and his agenda for the american people.   blitzer: but why did you resign? i'm still trying to understand. i understand that you told the president you wanted to resign. he accepted your resignation yesterday. but why? were there a series of issues? was there one thing that came up and you decided, you know what, i no longer can do this?   priebus: look, i think the president wanted to go a different direction. i support him in that.
we are getting more information about the shakeup with the president's chief of staff and despite a couple wh officials saying that reince priebus resigned, it appears he was fired. reuters is sourcing a wh official who says that "trump informed priebus two weeks ago that he would be replacing him as white house chief of staff."  the president also talked, briefly, about moving general john kelly from homeland security secretary to chief of staff.
is donald trump encouraging police brutality and removing due process? during a speech in long island, ny, about cracking down on violent gangs, he launched into a wince worthy moment:  "when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in, rough, i said, please don't be too nice. like when you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over. like, don't hit their head and they've just killed somebody. don't hit their head. i said, 'you can take the hand away, okay?'"
it looks like the president was up overnight watching the vote in the senate. a vote that ended with a failure to repeal obamacare. at 2:25am donald trump tweeted, "3 republicans and 48 democrats let the american people down. as i said from the beginning, let obamacare implode, then deal. watch!"  but instead of saying let's watch obamacare implode, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell spoke to the floor after the vote, clearly disappointed, but admitting it is time to move on.
late last night, john mccain cast the decisive vote to sink gop efforts on health care. donald trump's number one campaign promise is dead, and it was blown up by a man who the president once said was "no hero."  from politico:  "but in the early hours of friday morning, the arizona republican, as well as sens. lisa murkowski of alaska and susan collins of maine, dealt the fatal punch to the gop’s seven-year campaign promise to shred obamacare apart. he's now become a hero for democrats, effectively voting to protect the chief legislative achievement of president barack obama, his opponent in the 2008 presidential campaign."
another first class hire at the white house! the new communications director did some serious communicating with a reporter from the new yorker. to say anthony "the mooch" scaramucci unloaded with both barrels would be the understatement of the day. the result is a scorched-earth, expletive-rich diatribe that confirms donald trump's staff is at war with itself.
it would be easy to ignore the latest trump braggadocio as just more of the same. but that would be a mistake, because to ignore would be to normalize and there is nothing normal about what donald trump said tonight in a speech in ohio.  and we quote: "with the exception of the late, great abraham lincoln, i can be more presidential than any president that's ever held this office"
reactions to senator john mccain's vote on health care, and his speech that followed, are coming in.  msnbc's joy reid tweeted the same sentiment as many others did saying,  "so it happened. mccain returned to the senate to a standing ovation, and promptly voted to take away millions of people's healthcare."  after his "yes" vote though, mccain spoke and didn't seem too supportive of the gop bill:  "i voted for the motion to proceed to allow debate to continue and amendments be offered. i will not vote for this bill as it is today. it's a shell of a bill right now. we all know that.   i have changes urged by my state's governor that will have to be included to earn my support for final passage of any bill. i know many of you will have to see the bill changed substantially for you to support it. we tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind closed doors, in consultation with the administration. then springing it on skeptical members, trying to convince them that it's better than nothing. that it's better than nothing? asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition. i don't think that's going to work in the end, and probably shouldn't.   the administration and congressional democrats shouldn't have forced through congress without social and economic change as massive as obamacare. and we shouldn't do the same with ours. why don't we try the old way of legislating in the senate, the way our rules and customs encourage us to act. if this process ends in failure, which seems likely, then let's return to regular order."  more of his speech is attached.
analysis: former acting director of the cia, john mclaughlin, tweeted, "trump's boy scout speech had the feel of a third world authoritarian's youth rally."  with that said, does this statement from the boy scouts of america go far enough?  “the boy scouts of america is wholly non-partisan and does not promote any one position, product, service, political candidate or philosophy. the invitation to visit the national jamboree is a long-standing tradition and is in no way an endorsement of any political party or specific policies.”  the boy scouts should probably also address the fact that the president's speech wasn't appropriate for children, no matter what their political affiliation.  cnn put together "the 29 most cringe-worthy lines from donald trump's hyper-political speech to the boy scouts."

looks like the president is now openly taunting jeff sessions, a man he appointed to attorney general. this morning donald trump tweeted:  "so why aren't the committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered a.g., looking into crooked hillarys crimes & russia relations?"  the question is how much longer will sessions be working with this administration?
this weekend president trump tweeted, "all agree the u. s. president has the complete power to pardon." but today senator chuck schumer told george stephanopoulos he believes few people would actually agree with the president pardoning himself, his family or his staff:  "if he fired mueller or pardoned himself or someone close to him under investigation, it would be among the greatest, greatest breaking of rule of law, of traditional democratic norms, of what our democracy is about. i think it could cause a cataclysm in washington. i cannot imagine our republican colleagues, including ryan or mitch mcconnell, standing by if he were to do that."
hope hicks has become a gate keeper of sorts for the president. she was also one of the few members of donald trump's staff who stayed relatively under the radar...until a few days ago.  politico reports:  she is protected, in a world of rival power centers, by the deep bond she shares with the man at the top. he affectionately refers to her as “hopester.” she still calls him “mr. trump.” and she views her job, ultimately, as someone who is installed where she is in order to help, but not change, the leader of the free world.  but an explosive trump interview this week with the new york times, in which hicks was the only aide in the oval office with the president, has thrust her protected and preferred under-the-radar status into fuller view.

despite what he's said, donald trump's relationships with russians goes back decades.    from new republic:  "but even without an investigation by congress or a special prosecutor, there is much we already know about the president’s debt to russia. a review of the public record reveals a clear and disturbing pattern: trump owes much of his business success, and by extension his presidency, to a flow of highly suspicious money from russia. over the past three decades, at least 13 people with known or alleged links to russian mobsters or oligarchs have owned, lived in, and even run criminal activities out of trump tower and other trump properties."  ----------  pour a cup of your favorite saturday morning beverage and enjoy a good piece of investigative journalism.
donald trump jr. and paul manafort won't testify publicly, at least not yet.  according to cnn:   the leaders of the senate judiciary committee have cut a deal with president donald trump's eldest son, donald trump jr., and former campaign chairman paul manafort to avoid a high-profile public hearing next week, with the two men agreeing to provide records to the panel and to be privately interviewed ahead of any public session.  in a joint statement, panel chairman chuck grassley and ranking member dianne feinstein said, "(w)e will not issue subpoenas for them tonight requiring their presence at wednesday's hearing but reserve the right to do so in the future."
remember when attorney general jeff sessions said: "i never had meetings with russian operatives or russian intermediaries about the trump campaign"?  turns out that may not have been true. according to the the new york times:  russia’s ambassador to washington told his superiors in moscow that he discussed campaign-related matters, including policy issues important to moscow, with jeff sessions during the 2016 presidential race, contrary to public assertions by the embattled attorney general, according to current and former u.s. officials.
our own dan rather appeared on hardball with chris matthews tonight to talk about the investigations involving the president. chris matthews asked dan why it seems like donald trump accuses anyone causing him "trouble" of being tainted.   dan said, "he's speaking out of fear and he's trying to intimidate, to contract where the investigation will go." he goes on to ask "what is he hiding?"
breaking now: oj simpson is going to be a free man in a few months. a nevada parole board unanimously  voted to allow the former football star to go free in october. at that time he will have served the minimum nine years that was required as part of his sentence.   simpson was convicted back in 2008 for armed robbery involving sports memorabilia in a las vegas hotel. he received a 33-year sentence, but many say the sentence was too tough. critics say the judge on the case handed the maximum time to simpson because of the cloud hanging over him after the murders of nicole brown and ron goldman.   in anticipation of the board's decision today ron goldman's father, fred goldman told good morning america, "needless to say, i'm upset... what's troubling to me is not only him, but the whole system gives second chances to violent felons, or for that matter, anyone in jail. ron doesn't get a second chance."  part of simpson's remarks to the parole board are attached.

"গ্যাস আঙ্কেল" . আমাদের বাড়িটা পাঁচতলা ফ্ল্যাট বাড়ি নয়। ছোটখাটো একটা বাড়ি। এই বাড়ির একটা ছোট্ট রুমে একজন ভাড়াটিয়া থাকেন। মুখে খোঁচা খোঁচা দাড়ি, চোখ দুটো রাক্ষসদের মতো লাল। আমি কখনও রাক্ষস দেখিনি, কিন্তু ওনাকে দেখলেই মনে হতো রাক্ষস দেখছি। আম্মুর মুখে যেদিন প্রথম ওনার নাম শুনলাম। সেদিন নামটা শুনে হাসি পেয়েছিলো। গ্যাস। ওই রাক্ষসের মতো লোকটির নাম গ্যাস। আম্মু টিপিক্যাল বাঙালি। ক্লাস টু ফেইল্ড। পড়াশোনায় কাচা বলে আমার নানা নানী আব্বুর ঘাড়ে আম্মুকে চাপিয়েছেন। আম্মুর মুখে গ্যাস কথাটা শুনতে বেশ মজাই লাগতো আর খুব হাসিও পেতো। আম্মুর মতো অত হাস্যকর ভাবে কেহই বলতে পারবেনা বললে ভুল হবে। পাশের বাসার এক আন্টিও আম্মুর মতো কথা বলে। আম্মু আর ঐ আন্টিকে এত বুঝানোর পরও লেখাপড়া কে নেকাপড়া, কাজকর্ম কে কাজকম্ম বলার অভ্যাস টা পরিবর্তন করাতে পারিনি। তখন সময়টা ১৯৭৯ এর ফেব্রুয়ারী মাস। গ্যাস আঙ্কেল আমাকে চকোলেট দেওয়ার জন্য ডাকতো। এমনিতেই ওনাকে হাস্যকর মনে হলেও ওনার সামনে যেতে আমি ভয় পেতাম। শুধু আমি নই কোনও ছোট্ট ছেলেমেয়ে ওনার চেহারার সুরত দেখে ভয় পেয়ে ওনার আশপাশে ভিড়তোনা। . উনি আমায় বিভিন্ন উপায়ে কাছে ডাকতেন। একদিন আমি রুমের ভিতরে একাই ছিলাম। আম্মু রান্না ঘরে, গ্যাস আঙ্কেল আমার রুমে এসে দরজায় দাড়িয়েছেন। আমি ভয়ে চিৎকার করে উঠেছিলাম। আম্মু এসে গ্যাস আঙ্কেল কে প্রচন্ড রকম বকলেন। তখন আমার চোখে পড়েছিলো গ্যাস আঙ্কেল কাঁদছেন। একজন দৈত্যের মতো লোক কে কাঁদতে দেখা চারটেখানি ব্যপার নয়। তখন এতকিছু বুঝতাম না। শুধুই ভয় পেতাম ওনাকে। . একদিন আমি রুমে শুয়ে ছিলাম। আচানক দেখি একটা বিষাক্ত সাপ রুমে ঢুকে আমার দিকেই আসছে। গ্যাস আঙ্কেল ব্যাপারটি দেখতে পেয়ে তড়িঘড়ি করে আমার রুমে এলেন। হাতে কোনও লাঠি ও নেওয়ার সময় পাননি। হাত দিয়ে সাপটিকে ধরতে গিয়ে অপ্রস্তুতের মতো সাপের ছোবল খেয়েছেন। পাশের রুম থেকে চেচামেচি শুনে আমার মা একটা লাঠি নিয়ে সাপটিকে মেরে ফেললেন। গ্যাস আঙ্কেল সাপটির হাত থেকে আমাকে রক্ষা করে নিজে ঢলে পড়েছেন মৃত্যুর কোলে।  . আমি অবাক হয়ে দেখলাম, যে লোকটাকে আমি ভয় পাই, মৃত্যু তাকে কত সহজেই টেনে নিয়ে গেলো। গ্যাস আঙ্কেলের মৃত্যু হয়েছে। গল্পটাও এখানেই শেষ হতে পারতো। কিন্তু হয়নি। . ওনার মৃত্যুর পর কেটে গেছে পাঁচবছর। আমিও একটু বড় হয়েছি, বুঝতে শিখেছি অনেক কিছুই। তখন আমি সপ্তম শ্রেনীতে। হঠাৎই ইচ্ছে হলো গ্যাস আঙ্কেলের রুম টাতে একবার যাই। রুমটাতে আর কোনও নতুন ভাড়াটে উঠেনি। আম্মু ই উঠতে দেননি। আম্মু বলেন, "যে লোকটা আমার ছেলের জীবন বাচিয়েছেন, তার জিনিসপত্র গুলো ফেলে দেওয়াও তাকে অপমান করা হবে" রুম টাতে তালা আটকানো। আম্মুর কাছে চাবি নিয়ে সেদিন প্রথমবারের মতো গ্যাস আঙ্কেলের রুমে প্রবেশ করলাম আমি। রুমের ভিতর ছবি অঁঙ্কনের রং তুলি আর ক্যানভাস পড়ে আছে। ক্যানভাসে ধুলো জমে আছে। ধুলো মুছে দেখলাম আমার ছবি।  . আমি একটা ডায়েরি খুজে পেলাম। ডায়েরির প্রথম পৃষ্টায় লেখা ছিলো, "আমি মোঃ গিয়াসউদ্দিন তরফদার, আজ পরিবার ছেড়ে যুদ্ধে যাচ্ছি। আমি জানি জয় আমাদেরই হবে, হয়তো অনেক পথ পেরুতে হবে। "  এরপর পুরো ডায়েরিতেই আরও অনেক কিছু লেখা। যেমন, " 11-7-1971, আজ আমরা অপারেশনে যাচ্ছি। হয়তো আর ফিরবোনা, হয়তো আর কখনও পরিবারের মুখ দেখা হবেনা" এভাবে প্রতিটা বিশেষ মুহুর্তের কথাই তিনি লিপিবদ্ধ করে রেখেছেন ডায়েরিতে। তার মধ্যে একটি হলো, "আজ আমরা বিজয়ী। পাকিস্তানি বাহিনী কে পরাজিত করেছি। এখন পরিবারে ফেরার পালা " . এর পর অনেকদিন ডায়েরিতে কিছুই লেখা হয়নি অনেকদিন। তারিখের দুরত্ব দেখে বুঝলাম। হয়তো মাঝখানে লেখার সময় পাননি। তারপর হঠাৎ একটা পৃষ্ঠায় লেখা, "১২-৫-১৯৭৮  আমি যুদ্ধে পরিবার হারিয়েছি, আমার ছোট্ট ছেলেকে হারিয়েছি। আবার আর একটা ছেলে পেয়েছি। আমার বাড়িওয়ালার ছেলে। খুবই ছোট্ট আদুরে। কিন্তু ও ভয় পায় আমাকে। ভীষণ ভয় পায়। আমি হয়তো দিনদিন কষ্টে জর্জরিত হয়ে অমানুষের মতো দেখতে হয়ে যাচ্ছি " . ডায়েরী পড়া শেষ। আমার চোখ বেয়ে টপটপ করে অশ্রু ঝরছে। গ্যাস (গিয়াস) আঙ্কেলকে আমি বুঝতে পারিনি। .... সমাপ্ত .... . লেখাঃ aritra arefin (অরিত্র আরেফিন)

কঠিন চ্যালেঞ্জের মুখে অপু বিশ্বাস
মন বাবুই . মির্জা নাহিদ হোসেন মনের খাচাঁটাই এমন এক জায়গা যেখানে শূন্যতা ও পূর্ণতার বোধ একই সাথে হয়।এই রাত জাগা শহরের ইট- কাঠের পাজঁরে যে আনন্দ ও বেদনা লুকিয়ে আছে সেখানে কবিতা যেমন আছে, তেমনি কাব্যহীনতার প্রকটতাও কম নেই। গত রাতে বাড়ীওয়ালা আমাকে অমায়িক হাসি দিয়ে বিদায় নোটিশ দিয়ে দিয়েছে।দোষ আমার না,আমার পকেটের।চার বছরের চৌকি,চৌকির তলার ইদু্ঁর,ঘরের কোনের মাকড়শা,মধ্য-দূপুরের অন্ধকার,স্যাতঁস্যাতে মেঝেও বুঝে গেছে আমি আর তাদের কেউ না।শূন্যতায় পূর্নতার খোজঁ তাদের।এ শহরে যখন এসেছিলাম,কেউ আমাকে নিতে আসেনি।যাবার বেলাও কেউ বিদায় দেবে সে আশা করাও বাতুলতা। মাথায় কতো স্বপ্ন ছিল,স্বপ্ন গুলো এখনও আছে কিনা জানি না।খোজঁ নেওয়া হয়নি বহুদিন। ফজরের আজান দিচ্ছে।কেন জানি না এতো অভ্যাস পাল্টালেও এটা এখনো আছে।বাবার স্মৃতি না শৈশবের অভ্যাস? আমার মতো বিত্তবান রুমমেটরা এখনো ঘুমুচ্ছে।ওদের ঘুমের মাঝে হয়তো স্বপ্ন আছে।ভোর বেলার স্বপ্ন। স্বপ্ন পূরনের আজন্ম লালিত স্বপ্নিল স্বপ্ন। ওদের স্বপ্নের মাঝে রেখেই নেমে পড়লাম রাস্তায়। সাথে এতো বেশী মালপত্র যে দু’হাতের তেমন দরকার নেই।কোথাও যাবো? কার কাছে যাবো? এসব চিন্তা এখন আর করি না।পথে নামলে পথই পথ দেখাবে।ভোরের অন্ধকার এতো দ্রুত কেটে যায়! ঢাকা শহর ঘুমায় চারটে থেকে সাতটা পর্যন্ত। কোন দোকানপাট, মানুষ আছে বলে মনে হয় না।কিছু নামাজি মানুষ ছাড়া আশে পাশে পিনপতন নিরবতা।কুয়াশার গান,গলির মহিলাদের কোরাস ভৈরবী ছাড়া আর কোন শব্দ নেই।উর্দু রোডের যেখানে থাকি, সেখানে স্বাস্থ্য সচেতন লোক নেই।এ বিলাসিতার সুযোগ ও হয় না বোধ হয়। খুব ইচ্ছা করছিল এককাপ চা আর একটা সিগারেট খেতে। দোকান-পাট সব বন্ধ। হাতের ব্যাগে একটা সিগারেট থাকার কথা।ম্যাচ কি আছে? পিনপতন নীরবতার মাঝে হঠাৎ কোথা থেকে হাজির পুলিশের গাড়ী।হ্যাঁ, আমাকেই ডাকছে।আমার অবাক হওয়ার কথা।অবাক হলাম না বলে- নিজেই অবাক হলাম। নাকি অবাক হবার বোধটাই হারিয়ে ফেলেছি? কবে? কখন?কোথায়? তাছাড়া পুলিশ তো রাত বারোটা থেকে ভোর চারটে পর্যন্ত টহল দেওয়াটা নিয়মে পরিনত করেছে।এখন কয়টা বাজে? মোবাইল টা ৭০০ টাকায় বেচে না দিলে সময় টা দেখা যেতো।এ ভাবনার সময় কতোটুকু বোঝার আগেই দেখি হাতে হাতকড়া। তাকিয়ে দেখি এসআই মফিজের এর মুখে চাপা হাসি। অনেকটা কোষ্ঠকাঠিন্য রোগীর বড়টা সারার পরের তৃপ্তির মতো। টাকার অভাবে আমার না কামানো দাড়িঁ, গোফঁ, চুল ওনার বড় পছন্দ! নাকি মেসে আমায় না পেয়ে এখানে আমায় দেখে ঈদের চাঁদ হাতে পেলেন? আমাকে কিছুই করতে হলো না।লাঠির ঠেলায় উঠে পড়লাম গাড়ীতে।হাতে হ্যান্ডক্যাপ থাকায় আমার চুল গুলো উনাদের আমাকে গাড়ীতে তুলতে সাহায্য করলো,আমি নিজেকে ধন্য মনে করলাম এটুকু সাহায্য করতে পারায়। ভোরের তাজা হাওয়ায় এতো দামী গাড়ীতে চড়তে এতো আরাম জানতাম না।অনন্তকাল চড়তে পারলে বেশ হতো। নিজেকে কেন যেন নায়ক নায়ক মনে হচ্ছে।আমার কাছে টাকা নেই এটা বড় লজ্জার কথা।পুলিশের গাড়ী ভাড়া কতো জানতে পারলে হতো।পকেটের একশো একুশ টাকায় কি হবে? আমার পোটলাটা কোথায়? ওখানে দু’একটা বই আছে।ওরা কি ওগুলো নেবে? তখন আর বয়স কতো হবে চৌদ্দ বা পনেরো ।দারুণ স্বপ্নময় সময়।সময়ের আচঁলে স্বপ্নদের ওড়াওড়ি। আর সে স্বপ্নে প্রথম প্রেম।জগতের প্রতিটা মেয়েকেই মোহনীয় ও নিজের মনে হওয়ার বয়স।তবুও কেউ আমার না,যদিও স্বপ্নে একেকদিন একেকজনের আনাগোনা। লজ্জা মেয়েদের নয় কিশোর ছেলেদের ভূষণ, যদি সে নিপাট নিম্ন মধ্যবিত্ত হয়।ভুলে ভালো রেজাল্ট করায় বিনা পয়সায় সুযোগ মিলে যায় গ্রামের কলেজে।ভালো জামা, কাপড়, খাবারের প্রতি লোভ ছিল না বললে মিথ্যা বলা হবে তবুও কিভাবে জানি শিখে ফেলেছিলাম ওগুলো আর যাই হোক আমার জন্য না। যতই বিনা মূল্যের হোক তবুও খাতা,কলম,পুরনো বই পত্র কিনতেও টাকা লাগে।এর ওর বাসায় পড়িয়ে মাসে দু’হাজার আয় হতো।মাঝে মাঝে খুব ইচ্ছা করতো চটপটি বা কাবাব খেতে।অযথা পয়সা নস্ট ভেবে কোনদিন খাওয়া হয়নি।পিতা কি জিনিস জানি না।মা যদিও বা আছেন তবে মমতার চেয়ে বেশী অসুস্থতা নিয়ে।সে সময় বুঝে গিয়েছিলাম মেয়েরা সহজে মরে না।বিরাট আদর্শ নিয়ে থাকলে সুন্দরীদের যা হয় তার সবই ছিল মায়ের মধ্যে।মা মানসিক রোগী ছিলেন বুঝি নি।যখন বুঝলাম দেখি খড়ি কাঠের সাথে মা দোল খাচ্ছেন আর আমি ভাবছি কি সুন্দর দোলনা মায়ের! কেন কান্না আসে নি? নাকি এ বয়সে এতো কেঁদেছি যে নতুন কোন কান্না আসতে নেই! পাশের বাড়ীর হাজী লুলু চাচা আর উনার মসজিদের হুজুর তো জানাজা পড়াতেই দেবেন না। লুলু চাচার বাবা টুনু খোড়াঁ পিস কমিটির চেয়ারম্যান হলেও উনি এখন বিশিষ্ট মুক্তিযোদ্ধার সন্তান।উনার অনেক দয়া,সবার অনুরোধের বিনিময়ে বসত ভিটাটা নিয়ে নিলেন। বিনিময়ে জানাজা আর হুজুরদের খাওয়ার ব্যবস্থা করলেন। তখন থেকে সারা পৃথিবী আমার ঘর।আকাশ আমার ছাদ। আমার ছাদটা কতো বড় আর কতো রঙ রাঙ্গানো! এরপরে পেটের টানে বেচেঁ দিলাম আমার শত রঙ এ রাঙ্গানো বিশাল ছাদটাও। সারাদিন রাত ধরে চলতো আধাঁরে প্রুফ দেখা।কতো রকম মানুষের কতোরকম ভনিতা।একুশে বই মেলার আগের তিনমাস চলতো অবিরাম খাটুনি।অবসরে দু’এক পাতা লিখেও ফেলতাম কখনো কখনো।ছাপাখানাটা তারচেয়েও ছোট মনের মালিকের সাথে দিব্যি মানিয়ে যেত।এটি ছিল তিনজনের বাসা কাম অফিস।রাতে মশাদের গান শুনতে শুনতে ঘুমিয়ে যেতাম।যেদিন ঘুম আসতো না সেদিন কল্পনার ফানুস উড়াতাম। দু’একজন বাদে লেখক বাদে বেশীরভাগ বই চলতো আমলাদের।এসব অখাদ্য বই এতো কিভাবে বিক্রি হতো আমার মাথায় আসতো না।কতো ভালো কবি ও কবিতার বই পরে থাকতো! মালিক একদিন আমাকে আমাকে অন্য মালিকের হাতে তুলে দিয়ে চলে গেলেন নিজ মালিকের কাছে।হয়তো আকাশের তারা হতে চেয়েছিলেন।এতো তারার মাঝে কি তারা হতে পেরেছিলেন? অনেক তারাদের মেলায় তাকে দেখিনি কখনো।একরাশ আধাঁরের মেলায় হয়তো আধাঁরে মিশে গেছেন। হঠাৎ দুনিয়ার সব আলো এসে চোখে লাগলো।এতো আলোর ঝলকানী আগে কোথায় দেখেছি? হাত দিয়ে চোখ ঢাকতেও ইচ্ছা করছিল না।ইচ্ছা করলেও পারতাম না।হাতের হ্যান্ডক্যাপ তখনও হাতে। সাংবাদিক ভাইদের আলোকময় ক্যামেরাই আমাকে দেখতে কেমন লাগছিল; জানতে ইচ্ছা হচ্ছিল খুব।আমি এতো বিখ্যাত কখনো জানতাম না।পুলিশ ভাইয়েরা আমার সামনে, পেছনে দাড়াঁনো নিয়ে নিজেদের মধ্যে প্রতিযোগীতায় ব্যস্ত।কে জেনো বলে উঠলো কার আম কার ছালায়।মিনিস্টার সাহেবের ছেলে এবারও বেচেঁ গেলেন। কে বললো? কেন? এসময় মিনিস্টার সাহেবের দেখাও পেয়ে গেলাম। কেমন যেন চেনা চেনা লাগছে! হঠাৎ মনে পড়লো আরে ইনিই তো আমার সেই এনায়েত ওরফে লুলু চাচা।চেহারা আরো চেকনায় হয়েছে।উনি অনর্গল ক্যামেরার সামনে বলে যাচ্ছেন কি কষ্ট ই না করেছেন উনার দপ্তরের কর্তা ব্যক্তিরা।আচ্ছা উনার বড় মেয়ে কি ফিরে এসেছিল? নাকি ভেটে পাঠানো মেয়েরা আর ফেরেনা?উনার বখে যাওয়া ছেলেটা কেমন আছে? দেশ বিদেশে আলোচিত এই আমার দিকে ফিরেও তাকানোর সময় পান নি।খুব ইচ্ছা হচ্ছিল কাছে পেলে একদলা থুতু দিতে। সব ইচ্ছা পূরণ হতে নেই। আকাশে একটি উড়োজাহাজ।সেখানে কি আমার মতো কেও আছে? আবার আধাঁর।এবার চোখে একটুকরো কালো কাপড়।চলতে চলতে হঠাৎ গাড়ীটা থেমে গেলো।তেল শেষ নাকি? এ গাড়ীটায় চড়ে তেমন আরাম নেই।এতো ঝাঁকুনি! একি মা এখানে এলেন কি করে! হঠাৎ এক ঝাঁক বিকট শব্দে দেখি আমি আমার মায়ের কোলে।মা হাসতে হাসতে বললেন, বোকা ছেলে এতো অসভ্য লোকদের সাথে তুই কেন? আয় বাজান আমার কোলে আয়।

কিছুদিন আগে বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংকের গভর্নর ফজলে কবির যখন নতুন প্রজন্মকে চাকরির পিছনে না ঘুরে নিজেকে উদ্যোক্তা হওয়ার আহবান জানিয়েছিলেন তখনো আমি টর্চ লাইট দিয়ে খুঁজে চট্টগ্রাম বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় স্কুল/কলেজ কিংবা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে এমন কোন বন্ধুকে খুঁজে পেলাম না যে উদ্যোক্তা হওয়ার স্বপ্ন দেখছে! . কাজী নিপু পেইজে একটি লেখা দেখেছিলাম এমন যখন মানুষ মঙ্গল গ্রহ জয় করার কথা ভাবছে আমরা তখন ভাবছি এই আকাশ ফুটো করে বের হবে কেমনে! . সত্যি বলতে কি বেশী কিছু লাগবে না বিশ টাকা দিয়ে একটি ফ্রুটিকা কিনে খেলেই হবে! . এই এক আজব দেশ আর.এফ.এল চেয়ারে বসলেই আপনি চেয়ারম্যান হয়ে যাবেন! . ম্যাজিক টুথ পাউডার দিয়ে দাঁত পরিষ্কার করলে জোরসে বলতে পারবেন! . ক্লোজ আপ ব্যবহার করলে কাছে আসার গল্প শুরু হবে! . স্পিড ইনস্টান্ট এনার্জি মুখে দিলে আপনাকে কেউ আর দৌড়িয়েও ধরতে পারবে না! . চট্টগ্রাম জিইসি সানমার শপিং মলে কিছুদিন আগে টি শার্টে হাত দেওয়ার পর বিক্রতা বলো ২৫০০ টাকা! আমি বললাম এতো পাতলা একটা টি শার্টের এতো দাম! সে বললো ভাই, এটা ওয়ান পিচ্ মেইড! মাত্র এক পিচ্ তৈরী করেছে বলে এতো দাম! সে আবারো বললো, ওয়ান পিচ্ মেইড বাট কারিগর ডেড্(died)! . ইন্নালিল্লাহ্! . সেদিন ইয়ুটিউবে লোহা বাবাকে দেখলাম শীর্ষদের নিয়ে লোহা খাচ্ছে তারপর 'প্রাণ হজম কেন্ডি' খাওয়ার পর নিমিষে সব লোহা হজম! . আমাদের চারপাশে এতো এতো মজার বিজ্ঞাপন থাকা সত্ত্বেও একজন বেকারের সামনে চাকরির বিজ্ঞাপন মানে হট্ কেক! ক্ষেত্র বিশেষে সবচেয়ে বড় বিনোদন! . কিছুদিন আগে চট্টগ্রাম বন্দরে চতুর্থ শ্রেণির লস্কর পদের জন্য পুরো বাংলাদেশ থেকে ৭৪ হাজার আবেদন জমা পড়েছিলো! তাদের অনেকে জানেনা লস্করের কাজ জাহাজ বাঁধা এবং পাহারা দেওয়া! সেখানে সবকিছু ছাড়িয়ে ৯০ জন মাদারিপুরের ছেলে চান্স পেয়েছে! বাকী দুই জন চট্টগ্রামের! . আমার বন্ধুদের মধ্যে অনার্স মাস্টার্স করা বলতে গেলে সবাই আবেদন করেছিলো! এমনকি শুধু উত্তর ক্যাম্পাস শোভাকলোণী থেকে বার/পনের জন হবে! . খবরে পেলাম আটত্রিশ তম বিসিএসে ৯৫৫টি পদের বিপরীতে আবেদন করেছেন প্রায় ৩ লক্ষ ৮৯ হাজার ৪৬৮ জন! . কোন সরকারী কিংবা বেসরকারী চাকরিজীবী একজন মানুষেরও কর্মসংস্থানও করতে পারেন না কিন্তু একজন ছোট খাটো উদ্যোক্তা শত থেকে শুরু করে হাজার মানুষের কর্মসংস্থান সৃষ্টি করতে পারেন! . আগামী বিসিএসে নিয়োগ পাবে এমন ৯৫৫ জন মেধাবী যদি আত্মকর্মসংস্থান করে তাদের প্রতিষ্ঠানে ৪০৭ জন করে নিয়োগ দেয় তাহলে চার লক্ষ বেকারত্ব নিমিষেই দূর হবে! . দেশে যখন ২৬ লক্ষ বেকার যুবক তখন ঢাকা কেন্দ্রীয় লাইব্রেরী খোলার আগে লম্বা লাইন লেগে যায়! . সেই ক্ষণে ‘চাকরি খুঁজব না চাকরি দেব’ স্লোগান নিয়ে এগিয়ে যাচ্ছে কিছু স্বপ্নবাজ তরুণ! . বাংলাদেশ পরিসংখ্যান ব্যুরোর (বিবিএস) মতে যেখানে ২০১৩ সালে তরুণ উদ্যোক্তা ছিলো ৫ লাখ তা ২০১৬ সালে বেড়ে হয়েছিলো ১৭ লাখ! . মজার ব্যাপার হলো একটি সরকারি চাকরির আবেদন থেকে শুরু করে নিয়োগ পক্রিয়ায় যতদিন সময় লাগে ততদিনে অনেক উদ্যোক্তা সফলতার মুখ দেখা শুরু করছেন! . আমার সন্দ্বীপের এক তরুণ উদ্যোক্তা আমার সাথে ৩৫ তম বিসিএস দিয়েছিলো! তাকে যখন জিজ্ঞেস করলাম ৩৭ তম দিবি না? সে বললো দোস্ত আমার খামারে এখন সাত জন চাকরি করে! . জীবনের প্রথমে প্রায় ত্রিশটি চাকরিতে রিজেক্ট হওয়া জ্যাক মা'য়ের আলী বাবা ডট কম নামক একটি ওয়েব সাইটের নিজস্ব ডিরেক্টলি প্রায় ৪৫ হাজার এবং ইন- ডিরেক্টলি লক্ষাদিক কর্মী রয়েছেন! . অ্যামাজন ডট কমে কাজ করছেন প্রায় আড়াই লক্ষ কর্মী! . আইসিটি পণ্য রফতানি করে বছরে ৮০ কোটি ডলার আয় করা হচ্ছে যা অতি নগন্য কিন্তু এই আইসিটি দিয়ে আশি হাজার কোটি ডলার আয় করা সম্ভব! . যোগাযোগ প্রযুক্তি প্রতিমন্ত্রী জুনাইদ আহমেদ পলক বলেছেন ২০২১ সালের মধ্যে আইসিটি খাতে বিশ লক্ষ কর্মসংস্থান হবে! . অবশ্যই সম্ভব! এই সেক্টরে ২৬ লক্ষ বেকারের কর্মসংস্থান সৃষ্টি করা সম্ভব তার আগে মেধাবীর মাথা থেকে বিসিএস কিংবা সরকারী চাকরির ভূত দূর করতে হবে! তাদের মাথা থেকে ইউনিক আইডিয়া বের করে আনতে হবে! . আই এম ফাউন্ডার অব আলি.দাদা.ডট.কম, টাউটারবাবা.ডট.কম, ফেসবাবা.ডট.কম ইজ মোর ইমফোর্টেন্ট দেন আই এম প্রশাসন ক্যাডার! এডমিন ক্যাডার! এক্সেট্রা এক্সেট্রা! . লিখেছেন, abdur rob sharif

▪নিউটনের প্রাথমিক শিক্ষা সম্পন্ন হয় বাড়ির পাশের এক ক্ষুদ্রায়তন স্কুলে। ১২ বছর বয়সে তাকে গ্রান্থামের ব্যাকরণ স্কুলে পড়াশোনার জন্য পাঠানো হয়। - ▪স্কুল জীবনের প্রথম থেকেই নিউটনের সবচেয়ে বেশি ঝোঁক ছিল বিভিন্ন ধরনের যন্ত্র তৈরির প্রতি। সেই বয়সেই তিনি উইন্ডমিল, জল-ঘড়ি, ঘুড়ি এবং সান-ডায়াল তৈরি করেছিলেন। এছাড়া তার গুরুত্বপূর্ণ নির্মাণ ছিল একটি চার চাকার বাহন যা আরোহী নিজেই টেনে চালাতে পারতেন।  - ▪নিউটন ট্রিনিটি কলেজ থেকে ১৬৬১ সনে মেট্রিকুলেশন পাশ করেন। কলেজে অধ্যয়নকালে তিনি তার পড়াশোনার খরচ চালানোর জন্য কলেজের বিভিন্ন স্থানে ভৃত্যের কাজ করতেন। - ▪স্নাতক শিক্ষা গ্রহণকালে নিউটন একটি ছোট বইয়ের তাক বা এ ধরনের কোন স্থানে তার সব বই সাজিয়ে রাখতেন। সেই তাক থেকে নিউটনের সে সময়ে লেখা বেশ কিছু নিবন্ধ পাওয়া গেছে। এই লেখাগুলোর বিষয়ের মধ্যে রয়েছে: কৌণিক বিভাজন, বক্রসমূহের বর্গকরণ,সঙ্গীতের অনন্য সুর সম্বন্ধে কিছু গাণিতিক হিসাব, ভিয়েটা এবং ভ্যান স্কুটেনের জ্যামিতিক সমস্যা, ওয়ালিস রচিত এরিথমেটিক অফ ইনফিনিটিস বইয়ের উপর কিছু মন্তব্য, গোলীয় আলোক গ্লাসের ঘর্ষণের ফলাফল, লেন্সের ত্রুটি এবং সকল ধরনের মূল বের করার সূত্র।  - ▪১৬৬৫ খ্রিস্টাব্দে স্নাতক ডিগ্রী লাভের প্রাক্কালেই নিউটন তার বিখ্যাত দ্বিপদী উপপাদ্য বিষয়ক সূত্র প্রমাণ করেন এবং একইসাথে ফ্লাক্‌সিয়নের পদ্ধতি (method of fluxion) আবিষ্কার বিষয়ক প্রথম তত্ত্ব প্রদান করেন - ▪নিউটন তার মহাকর্ষ তত্ত্ব আবিষ্কার বিষয়ক দিনপঞ্জির সূচনা চিহ্নিত করেছিলেন এই ১৬৬৬ সনকে - ▪একই সময়ে তিনি আলোকবিজ্ঞান বিষয়ে তার একটি মৌলিক পরীক্ষণের কাজ সম্পন্ন করেন। এই পরীক্ষণের মাধ্যমে তিনি সাদা আলোর গাঠনিক অংশসমূহ আবিষ্কারে সক্ষম হন।  - ▪২৭তম জন্মদিনের কিছুদিন আগে তিনি ট্রিনিটি কলেজে গণিত বিভাগের লুকাসিয়ান অধ্যাপক নিযুক্ত হন।  - ▪১৬৬৮ খ্রিস্টাব্দে নিউটন একটি প্রতিফলন দূরবীক্ষণ যন্ত্র তৈরি করে ফেলেছিলেন। ১৬৭১ সনের ডিসেম্বরে নিউটন দ্বিতীয় আরেকটি দূরবীন তৈরি করে রয়েল সোসাইটিকে উপহার দেন। - ▪আলোক বিজ্ঞান সম্বন্ধে তার গবেষণাপত্রসমূহের অধিকাংশই ১৬৭২ সন থেকে ১৬৮৪ সনের মধ্যে রয়েল সোসাইটি থেকে প্রকাশিত হয়। তার এই গবেষণাপত্রগুলোই ১৭০৪ সনে তার অপটিক্‌স নামক গ্রন্থে সংকলিত হয়েছিল। - ▪১৬৮৭ সালে তার লেখা সবচেয়ে বিখ্যাত গ্রন্থ তথা ফিলোসফিয়া ন্যাচারালিস প্রিন্সিপিয়া ম্যাথামেটিকা যার ইংরেজি নাম দেয়া হয় mathematical principles of natural philosophy এই বইটি প্রকাশিত হয়। - ⭕সরকারি চাকরি ও ধর্মতত্ত্ব বিষয়ে গবেষণাঃ ▪১৬৯৫ খ্রিস্টাব্দে ইংলেন্ড সরকারের ওয়ার্ডেন অফ দ্য মিন্ট এবং পরবর্তীতে মাস্টার অফ দ্য মিন্ট পদে অধিষ্ঠিত হন। মৃত্যুর পূর্ব পর্যন্ত তিনি এই মাস্টার অফ দ্য মিন্ট পদেই বহাল ছিলেন। . ⭕ শেষ জীবন ▪১৭০৫ খ্রিস্টাব্দে তিনি নাইট উপাধিতে ভূষিত হন। ▪ ১৭২৫ খ্রিস্টাব্দের পর নিউটনের স্বাস্থ্যের ব্যাপক অবনতি ঘটে।১৭২৭ খ্রিস্টাব্দের ২০ মার্চ তারিখে ৮৫ বছর বয়সে তিনি মৃত্যুবরণ করেন। তাকে লন্ডনের ওয়েস্টমিনিস্টার অ্যাবে-তে সমাধিস্থ করা হয়। . ⭕গবেষণা কর্ম ও আবিষ্কার সম্পাদনাঃ ▪বর্তমানকালের গণিতজ্ঞ ও ইতিহাসবিদদের মতে নিউটন এবং লাইবনিজ প্রায় একই সাথে গণিতের একটি নতুন শাখার উন্নয়ন ঘটিয়েছিলেন যা ক্যালকুলাস নামে পরিচিতি লাভ করে। - ▪নিউটন দ্বিপদী উপপাদ্যের একটি সাধারণ রুপ উদ্ভাবনের জন্য বিখ্যাত। ▪এছাড়াও নিউটন আবিষ্কার করেন: নিউটনের আইডেনটিটি, নিউটনের পদ্ধতি, শ্রেণীবিন্যাসকৃত ঘনতলীয় বক্র (দ্বিচলবিশিষ্ট তিন মাত্রার বহুপদী)। তিনিই প্রথম আত্মবিশ্বাসের সাথে power series ব্যবহার করেন এবং একে revert করেন।  এছাড়া পাই-এর জন্য একটি নতুন সূত্র আবিষ্কার করেন। - ▪১৬৭০ থেকে ১৬৭২ খ্রিস্টাব্দ সময়ে তিনি আলোর প্রতিসরণ আবিষ্কার করেন। - ▪তিনি একটি প্রতিফলন দূরবীক্ষণ যন্ত্র নির্মাণ করেন যা বর্তমানে নিউটনীয় দূরবীক্ষণ যন্ত্র নামে পরিচিত - ⭕"মহাকর্ষ নিয়ে তিনি আগে থেকেই চিন্তিত ছিলেন। এমন সময় বাগানে গবেষণার মুড নিয়ে বসে থাকার সময় গাছ থেকে একটি আপেল মাটিতে পতিত হয়। আপেলটি কেন সব সময় অভিলম্ব বরাবর মাটির দিকে পতিত হয়, তিনি নিজের মনে চিন্তা করেন। কেন পাশে বা উপর দিকে যায়না, সবসময়ই কেন পৃথিবীর কেন্দ্রের দিক বরাবর পতিত হয়"। . ⭕সমালোচনাঃ ▪বিজ্ঞানী স্টিফেন হকিং তার "আ ব্রিফ হিস্টরি অফ টাইম "গ্রন্থের পরিশিষ্টে নিউটনের ব্যক্তিগত জীবন সম্পর্কে বেশ কিছু সমালোচনা প্রকাশিত হয়েছে। তার প্রিন্সিপিয়া বই প্রকাশিত হওয়ার পর নিউটন বিপুল জনপ্রিয়তা অর্জন করেন, রয়েল সোসাইটির সভাপতি নির্বাচিত হন এবং প্রথম বিজ্ঞানী হিসেবে নাইট উপাধি লাভ করেন। এর পরপরই নিউটনের সাথে দুইজন জ্যোতির্বিজ্ঞানী যারা তার প্রিন্সিপিয়া বই লিখার সময় তথ্য দিয়ে সাহায্য করেছিলেন তাদের সাথে সংঘর্ষ বাঁধে। এরা হলেন রয়েল এবং ফ্ল্যামস্টিড। সংঘর্ষের কারণ, নিউটন তাদের কাছ থেকে এমন কিছু তথ্য চেয়েছিলেন যা তারা দিতে সম্মত হন নি। নিউটন কোনো না সহ্য করতে পারতেন না। তিনি নিজেকে রয়েল মানমন্দিরের পরিচালনা পরিষদে অন্তর্ভুক্ত করে তার চাওয়া সেই ত থ্য-উপাত্তগুলোর অবিলম্বে প্রকাশের দাবী করেন। কিন্তু তিনি উপাত্তগুলো পান নি। এরই ধারাবাহিকতায় তিনি ফ্ল্যামস্টিডের গবেষণাকর্ম তার কাছ থেকে কেড়ে নিয়ে এডমন্ড হ্যালির নামে প্রকাশের ব্যবস্থা করেন; অথচ হ্যালি ছিলেন ফ্ল্যামস্টিডের আজীবন শত্রু। সুবিচারের আশায় ফ্ল্যামস্টিড আদালতের আশ্রয় নেন এবং বিচারের পর তার কাছ থেকে চুরি করে নেওয়া গবেষণাকর্মের প্রকাশনা বণ্টনের উপর নিষেধাজ্ঞা আরোপ করা হয়। প্রতিশোধ নেওয়ার জন্য নিউটন তার লেখা প্রিন্সিপিয়া বইয়ের পরবর্তী সংস্করণসমূহে ফ্ল্যামস্টিডের নামে উল্লেখিত সকল তথ্যসূত্র কেটে বাদ দিয়ে দেন। - ▪ নিউটনের সাথে আরেকটি বড় ধরনের বিরোধ ছিল জার্মান দার্শনিক ও গণিতজ্ঞ গটফ্রিড লাইবনিজের। লাইবনিজ এবং নিউটন সম্পূর্ণ স্বাধীনভাবে প্রায় একই সময়ে বিজ্ঞানের একটি নতুন শাখার উন্নয়ন ঘটান যা ক্যালকুলাস নামে পরিচিত। আধুনিক পদার্থবিজ্ঞানের অন্যতম ভিত্তি হচ্ছে এই শাখাটি। যদিও আমরা এখন জানি নিউটন লাইবনিজের কয়েক বছর পূর্বেই এটি আবিষ্কার করেছিলেন, তবে তিনি তা প্রকাশ করেছিলেন অনেক পরে অর্থাৎ ১৬৯৩ সনে; আর পূর্ণ বিবরণ প্রকাশ করেছিলেন ১৭০৪ খ্রিস্টাব্দে। অথচ লাইবনিজ তার কাজের একটি পূর্ণ বিবরণ ১৬৮৪ সালেই প্রকাশ করেছিলেন। মূলত লাইবনিজের ব্যবকলন পদ্ধতিই পরবর্তীকালে মহাদেশ জুড়ে গৃহীত হয়েছিল।কে আগে এটি আবিষ্কার করেছেন তা নিয়ে তৎকালীন বিজ্ঞানী সমাজের মাঝে প্রবল বিতর্কের সূত্রপাত ঘটে। দুজনের বিরুদ্ধে ও পক্ষেই অনেক লেখালেখি হয়। আশ্চর্যের বিষয়, নিউটনের পক্ষে লিখিত অধিকাংশ নিবন্ধই ছিল তার নিজের লেখা এবং তার বন্ধুদের নামে প্রকাশিত। বাগ্‌বিতণ্ডা চলতে থাকায় লাইবনিজ বিষয়টি রয়েল সোসাইটিতে উত্থাপন করেন। সোসাইটির সভাপতি নিউটন এর সঠিক অণুসন্ধানের জন্য তার বন্ধুদের নিয়ে একটি পক্ষপাতিত্বমূলক কমিটি গঠন করেন। এই কমিটি পূর্ণ ক্ষমতায় কাজ শুরু করে ১৭১১ সনে। রয়েল সোসাইটির প্রতিবেদনে লাইবনিজকে গবেষণা কর্ম চুরির দায়ে অভিযুক্ত করা হয়। এরপর নিউটন নাম গোপন করে এক সাময়িকীতে রয়েল সোসাইটির প্রতিবেদনের পক্ষেও লিখেছিলেন। লাইবনিজের মৃত্যুর পর নিউটন বলেছিলেন. লাইবনিজের মন ভেঙ্গে দিয়ে তিনি খুব শান্তি পেয়েছেন। লাইবনিজের সাথে যখন তার বিরোধ চলছিল তখনই নিউটন কেমব্রিজ ছেড়ে চলে গিয়েছিলেন। বিজ্ঞানের জগৎ ছেড়ে তিনি ক্যাথলিক-বিরোধী রাজনীতি ও পরবর্তীকালে সংসদীয় কাজে যোগ দেন। একসময় রয়েল মিন্টের ওয়ার্ডেনের মতো গুরুত্বপূর্ণ পদে অধিষ্ঠিত হন। সেখান থেকে তিনি জাল-বিরোধী কর্মকাণ্ডকে জোরদার করে তুলেন। এর কারণে অনেককে প্রাণ দিতে হয়েছিল বলে স্টিফেন হকিং তার বইয়ে লিখেছেন। ---#শ্রাবণী

(এই শীতের রাতে) না থাক তার চেয়ে বরং গল্প করি। বলো কি বলবে? স্ত্রীঃআপনি তো আচ্ছা বরিং মানুষ। কথা বলতেও পারেন না ঠিক ভাবে। আমার নাম জিজ্ঞেস করেন। স্বমীঃ ওহহ আচ্ছা তোমার নামতো রাইসা, তাই না? স্ত্রীঃ আরে দুর এভাবে কি কেউ জিজ্ঞেস করে? স্বামীঃ তাহলে কি ভাবে জিজ্ঞেস করে? স্ত্রীঃ বলবেন..."তোমার নাম কি? " স্বামীঃ কিন্তু আমি তো তোমার নাম জানি। স্ত্রীঃ উফ...আপনাকে কিন্তু যা বলতে বলছি তাই বলেন। স্বমীঃওকে....তোমার নাম কি? : আমি রাইসা। : কিসে পড়ো? : অনার্স ২য় বর্ষ। : আর কি? : ধুর ছাই,,,, কি বরিং মানুষ আপনি? : আবার কি করলাম? :ওকে আপনার প্রশ্ন করতে হবে না। আমি নিজে থেকেই বলছি। : যানেন আমার সব ফ্রেন্ড রা রিলেশন করতো। কিন্তু আমি করতাম না। : কেনো? : কারণ আমি আমার বরের দুষ্ট মিষ্টি বউ হতে চাইছি সব সময়। : কি রকম? : আমি সব সময় চাইছি,,,, আমার সব ভালোবাসা আমি আমার বরকে দিবো। আর ওকে খুব জ্বালাবো। : কি রকম? : জানেন আমার চাহিদা গুলো খুব সামান্য। আমার বাড়ি, গাড়ি, ভালো পোশাক, দামি ফার্নিচার কিছুই চাইনা। : তাহলে কি চাই? : রোজ সকালে আপনি যখন অফিসে যাবেন, তখন আমার কপালে একটা চুমু দিবেন। : আর? : দুপুরে খাবার আগে যেখানেই থাকেন, আমাকে একটা কল দিবেন। না হলে আমি না খেয়েই থাকবো। : ওকে দিবো। আর? : অফিস থেকে ফেরার সময় আমার জন্য, চকলেট, আইসক্রিম, ফুসকা, কিছু না কিছু আনতে হবে। : আর? : যদি কখনো ভুলে যান তবে আবার বাইরে পাঠাই দিবো। : ওকে আনবো। আর? : ভালবাসা দিবস, মেরেজ ডে, সহ সব ভালো ভালো দিনে আমায় নতুন করে প্রপোজ করতে হবে। কিন্তু কোন ফুল দেওয়া যাবে না। : এটা কেমন কথা? : জী এমনি কথা। : আর? : আমার কুয়াশা, চাদনী রাত, ঠান্ডা খুব ভালো লাগে। তাই মাঝে মাঝে ঘুরতে নিয়ে যেতে হবে। ব্যস্ত থাকলে বলবো না। : ওকে। : মাঝে মাঝে চাদনী রাতে, বেল কোনিতে বসে এক কাপে দুজন কফি খাবো। : এক কাপে কেন? : হুম এক কাপেই খাবো। : ওকে, আর? : মাঝে মাঝে বৃষ্টির রাতে ছাদে গিয়ে দুজনে ভিজবো। আর তুমি কদম ফুল দিয়ে আমায় প্রপোজ করবে। : এই শহরে কদম ফুল কোথায় পাবো? : আমি জানি না। আর রাগ করলেও কদম ফুল দিয়ে রাগ ভাঙ্গাতে হবে। : এটাতো রিতিমত টর্চার। সারা বছর কদম ফুল কই পাবো? : আমি জানি না। : আচ্ছা অন্য ফুলের কথা বলো। : না। কদম ফুল না দিতে পারলে আমায় কোলে নিতে হবে। যতখন মন ভালো হয়নি ততখন কোলে নিয়ে থাকতে হবে। : এই ৪৮ কেজির বস্তারে কোলে নিলে আমি বাচবো? : আমি জানি না। কদিন পর আরো মোটা হবো। তবুও কোলে নিতে হবে। : বলেকি?প্রথমের গুলাইতো ভালো ছিল। : সব গুলাই ভালো, কোলে নিবে কিনা বলেন? : ওকে বাবা নিবো। : শোনেন। : হুম বলো। : আপনার এই বোকা বোকা চশমাটা একটু খুলবেন। : কেনো। : আপনাকে দেখবো। এত মোটা ফ্রেমের চশমা পড়েন, এখনো ভালো করে আপনাকে দেখি নাই। : আচ্ছা আমি ঘুমাবো,,,, কাল কথা হবে গুড নাইট। : এই যে শোনেন এখানে তো একটা বালিশ, আমি কোথায় ঘুমাবো। : আমার বুকের উপর। : মানে? : তোমার যেমন আমাকে নিয়ে অনেক স্বপ্ন। ঠিক তেমন তোমাকে নিয়ে আমার একটা স্বপ্ন। আমার বউ সব সময় আমার বুকে মাথা দিয়ে ঘুমাবে। সারাদিন যত রাগ ঝগড়াই হোক , রাতের বেলা যেন কেউ কখনো অন্যজনকে ছাড়া না ঘুমাতে পারে এই হলো প্রেম। । । । এই হলো ভালোবাসা যা বিয়ের পরেই হয়। বিয়ের পরের এই প্রেম ভালোবাসাকেই ইসলাম সমর্থন করে, উৎসাহ প্রদান করে #সংগ্রহীত

একটি আশ্চর্য ঘটনাঃ আল্লাহর পক্ষে সবই সম্ভব . মক্কার এক কিশোর, যিনি তখনও যৌবনে পদার্পণ করেননি। কুরাইশ গোত্রের এক সর্দার 'উকবা ইবন আবু মু'ইতের একপাল ছাগল নিয়ে তিনি মক্কার গিরিপথগুলোতে চরিয়ে বেড়াতেন। নিয়ম অনুযায়ী প্রতিদিন সকালে উঠে 'উকবার ছাগলের পাল নিয়ে বের হয়ে যেতেন আর সন্ধ্যায় ফিরতেন। . একদিন এ কিশোর ছেলেটি দেখতে পেলেন, দু'জন বয়স্ক লোক, যাদের চেহারায় আত্মমর্যাদার ছাপ বিরাজমান, দূর থেকে তাঁর দিকেই এগিয়ে আসছেন। তাঁরা এত পরিশ্রান্ত ও পিপাসার্ত ছিলেন যে, তাঁদের ঠোঁট ও গলা শুকিয়ে কাঠ হয়ে গিয়েছিল। নিকটে এসে লোক দু'টি সালাম জানিয়ে বললেন, 'বৎস! এ ছাগলগুলি থেকে কিছু দুধ দুইয়ে আমাদেরকে দাও। আমরা পান করে পিপাসা নিবৃত্ত করি এবং আমাদের শুকনা গলা একটু ভিজিয়ে নেই।' ছেলেটি বললেনঃ 'এ আমার দ্বারা সম্ভব নয়। ছাগলগুলি তো আমার নয়। আমি এগুলির রাখাল ও আমানতদার মাত্র।' লোক দু'জধ তার কথায় অসন্তুষ্ট হলেন না, বরং তাদের মুখ মন্ডলে এক উৎফুল্লতার ছাপ ফুটে উঠলো। তাঁদের একজন আবার বললেনঃ 'তাহলে এমন একটি ছাগী আমাকে দাও যা এখনো পাঁঠার সংস্পর্শে আসেনি।' ছেলেটি নিকটেই দাঁড়িয়ে থাকা একটি ছোট্ট ছাগীর দিকে ইশারা করে দেখিয়ে দিলেন। লোকটি এগিয়ে গিয়ে ছাগীটি ধরে ফেলেন এবং 'বিসমিল্লাহির রাহমানির রাহীম' বলে হাত দিয়ে ধরে তার ওলান মলতে লাগলেন। অবাক বিস্ময়ে ছেলেটি এ দৃশ্য দেখে মনে মনে বললেনঃ 'কখনও পাঁঠার (পুরুষ ছাগলের) সংস্পর্শে আসেনি এমন ছোট ছাগী কি করে দুধ দেয়?' কিন্তু কি আশ্চর্য! কিছুক্ষণের মধ্যেই ছাগীর ওলানটি ফুলে উঠে এবং প্রচুর পরিমাণ দুধ বের হতে থাকে। দ্বিতীয় লোকটি গর্তবিশিষ্ট পাথর উঠিয়ে নিয়ে বাঁটের নীচে ধরে তাতে দুধ ভর্তি করেন। তারপর তাঁরা উভয়ে পান করেন এবং ছেলেটিকেও তাঁদের সাথে পান করালেন। ছেলেটি যা কিছু দেখছিলেন সবই তাঁর কাছে অবিশ্বাস্য মনে হচ্ছিল। সবাই যখন পরিতৃপ্ত হলেন তখন সেই পুণ্যবান লোকটি ছাগীর ওলানটি লক্ষ্য করে বললেনঃ 'চুপসে যাও।' আর অমনি সেটি পূর্বের ন্যায় চুপসে গেল। এরপর কিশোর ছেলেটি সেই পুণ্যবান লোকটিকে অনুরোধ করলেনঃ 'আপনি যে কথাগুলি উচ্চারণ করলেন, তা আমাকে শিখিয়ে দিন।' লোকটি বললেনঃ 'তুমি তো শিক্ষাপ্রাপ্ত বালক।' . এ মহাপুণ্যবান ব্যক্তিটি আর কেউ নন, তিনি স্বয়ং বিশ্ব মানবতার মহান মুক্তিদূত, সর্বশ্রেষ্ঠ মানব রাসূলুল্লাহ সাল্লাল্লাহু আলাইহি ওয়া সাল্লাম, আর তাঁর সঙ্গীটি ছিলেন হযরত আবু বকর সিদ্দীক (রা)। কুরাইশদের অত্যাচার উৎপীড়ন থেকে বাঁচার জন্য এ সময় তাঁরা মক্কার গিরিপথ সমূহে আশ্রয় নিয়েছিলেন। রাসূল (সা) ও তাঁর সঙ্গীকে যেমন ছেলেটির ভালো লেগেছিল তেমনি তাঁদের কাছেও ছেলেটির আচরণ, আমানতদারী ও বিচক্ষণতা খুব চমৎকার মনে হয়েছিল। এ ঘটনার অল্প কিছুদিন পরেই সেই কিশোর ছেলেটি ইসলাম গ্রহণ করেন এবং সৃষ্টিজগতের শ্রেষ্ঠতম মানুষের খাদিম হিসেবে নিজেকে উৎসর্গ করেন। ছাগলের রাখাল সেই সৌভাগ্যবান বালকটি ছিলেন হযরত আবদুল্লাহ ইবনে মাসউদ (রা) । . .

প্রশ্ন  : ঘুমানোর পূর্বে সূরা মুলক পাঠের বিশেষ কোন ফযীলত আছে কি?  ---------  উত্তর : ঘুমানোর পূর্বে সূরা মুলক পাঠের বিশেষ ফযীলত আছে। যেমন জাবের (রাঃ) বলেন, রাসূল (ছাঃ) সূরা সাজদা ও মুল্ক না পড়ে রাতে ঘুমাতেন না (তিরমিযী হা/৩০৬৬; মিশকাত হা/২১৫৫)। তিনি বলেন, ‘নিশ্চয়ই কুরআনে একটি সূরা আছে যাতে ৩০ টি আয়াত রয়েছে, পাঠকারীর জন্য এটি সুফারিশ করবে। এমনকি তাকে ক্ষমা করে দেয়া হবে। সেটি হ’ল সূরা মুলক’ (তিরমিযী হা/২৮৯১; মিশকাত হা/২১৫৩; ছহীহুল জামে‘ হা/২০৯১)। অন্য বর্ণনায় রয়েছে, ইবনু মাসঊদ (রাঃ) বলেন, বান্দাকে কবরে রাখা হ’লে পায়ের দিক হ’তে আযাব আসে। তখন পা বলে, আমার দিক থেকে আযাব দেওয়ার কোন সুযোগ নেই। কারণ তিনি আমাদের উপর সূরা মুলক তিলাওয়াত করতেন। এরপর পেটে শাস্তি দিতে চাইলে পেট বলে, আমাকে শাস্তি দেওয়ার কোন সুযোগ নেই। কারণ তিনি আমার মধ্যে সূরা মুলক আয়ত্ব করতেন। মাথার দিক থেকে আযাব আসতে চাইলে মাথা বলবে, আমার দিকে দিয়ে আসার কোন সুযোগ নেই। কারণ তিনি আমার মধ্যে সূরা মুলক তিলাওয়াত করতেন (মু‘জামুল কাবীর হা/৮৬৫১; হাকেম হা/৩৮৩৯; ছহীহ আত-তারগীব হা/১৪৭৫)।  উল্লেখ্য, সূরা সাজদা ও মুল্ক রাত্রিতে পাঠ করলে অন্যান্য সূরার তুলনায় ৬০ গুণ বেশী নেকী পাওয়া যায় বলে যে হাদীছ বর্ণিত হয়েছে তা যঈফ (দারেমী, মিশকাত হা/২১৭৬)।

বায়জিদ থেকে অক্সিজেন যাওয়ার সময় হঠাৎ খেয়াল করলাম প্রেমিক প্রেমিকা রিক্সার হুট তুলে দিয়েছে বৃষ্টিতে ভিজবে বলে হেব্বি রোমান্স হচ্ছে কিন্তু সে রিক্সায় আরো একজন ভিজছে কিন্তু সে রোমান্টিক হতে পারছে না ! টেনে চলছে ! তার জীবনেও একটি ভালবাসার গল্প আছে ৷ অন্যরকম রোমান্টিকতার গল্প ! . আকাশের গর্জন দেখলে কেউ একজনের মন খারাপ হয় ! বুড়োটার বয়স হয়েছে ! না জানি কোন পথে রিক্সা টানছে কে জানে ! কত করে বলি বৃষ্টি আসলে রিক্সা চালানোর দরকার নেই ! বদমাইশ বেটা ! কথা শুনে না ! . অক্সিজেন থেকে চট্টগ্রাম বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় আসার সময় একটি সিএনজিতে উঠলাম ৷ চালককে বার বার কে যেন ফোন করছে ! সে রেগে গিয়ে বললো, 'ওডি তোরে কইছিনা গাড়ি চালাচ্ছি ! এতোবার ফোন দেস কেন ! তাড়াতাড়ি চলে আসলে খাবি কি !' এটা কি ভালবাসার গল্পে পড়বে ? . চট্টগ্রাম বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় ঢুকার সময় একটি ভালবাসার গল্প খুঁজছিলাম ! সিএনজিতে পাশে এক মেয়ে উঠার কারণে আমাকে সামনে যেতে হলো ড্রাইভারের পাশে কিন্তু সিট ভিজা থাকার কারণে পাছা ভিজে যাচ্ছিলো কি দরকার ছিলো সেক্রিপাইস করে এমন একটি গল্প তৈরী করার ! . ভিজা নিতম্ব দেখলে অনেকে মনে করে খাইছেরে কাম সাইরা দিছে মনে হয় গুরু ! সেই লজ্জায় দৌড়ে নেমে অন্ধকার পথে যাওয়ার আগেই পিছন থেকে মিষ্টি কন্ঠ ভেসে আসলো ভাইয়া এটা মনে হয় আপনার ছাতি ? ধন্যবাদ দিয়ে মনে মনে বললাম, দুই জইন্যা এতো বড় ছাতি কি পাশে নিয়ে চলা যায় তাই ভুলে রেখে যাচ্ছিলাম ! মেয়েটি মনে হয় হাতি শুনেছিলো ! তার নিজের সাথে মিলিয়ে একটি দুই লাইনের ইতিহাস বলেছিলো.....! আমি দুইজইন্যা হাতি.....! . চট্টগ্রাম বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় উত্তর ক্যাম্পাস শোভাকলোণিতে আমার বাসা হওয়ায় সব বৃষ্টি ভেজা ভালবাসার গল্পের এখানেই সমাপ্তি হয় ! একটু বৃষ্টি হলেই রাস্তায় পানি উঠে যায় ! তবুও আরো একটি ভালবাসার গল্প না বললে অপূর্ণতা থেকে যাবে ৷ . পছন্ড বৃষ্টি হচ্ছিলো সেদিন ! কোথাও কেউ নেই ৷ রাস্তায় এক হাটু পানি ৷ মেয়েটির প্রসব বেদনা উঠেছিলো ! দাইমা দিয়ে কিছু হচ্ছিলো না ! স্বামী কাউকে না পেয়ে একটি পরিত্যাক্ত ভ্যানে নিজের স্ত্রী'কে প্লাস্টিক মুড়ি দিয়ে টেনে টেনে পাশের একটি হাসপাতালে নিয়ে গেলো ! অনেকক্ষণ পর তার একটি মেয়ে সন্তান হলো ততক্ষণে মেয়েটির মা আর পৃথিবীতে নেই ! বাবা পরে মেয়েটির নাম রেখেছিলো 'বৃষ্টি !' . কাল বৃষ্টির বিয়ে.... তার বাবা আজ মহাব্যস্ত ! পরশু প্লিজ এক টুকরো মেঘের বদলে তুমি রোদ নিয়ে এসো ! . চোখের জল বৃষ্টিতে ভিজে যায় কিন্তু রোদে শুকিয়ে গেলে স্মৃতি রেখে যায় ! স্মৃতিটুকু না থাকলে তরশু সে কি নিয়ে বাঁচবে ! . লিখেছেন, abdur rob sharif

এক দেশে এক সাহসী, বিচক্ষণ, ন্যায়পরায়ণ, দয়ালু, আর সুন্দর মনের রাজা ছিলেন। . রাজ দরবারে প্রায় বিভিন্ন সুন্দরী রমনীদের এনে রাজ প্রাসাধের মনোরঞ্জন করানোর জন্য নাচানো হতো। এমনই একজন অপরূপ রমনীকে রাজ দরবারে নাচার জন্য পেশ করা হলো।  . রাজার অঠেল সম্পত্যি আর ক্ষমতার কোন অভাব না থাকলেও। রাজার মুখে সৌন্দর্য বলে কিছুই ছিলনা। রাজা অনেক অসুন্দর ছিলেন। মানে কুৎসিত..... . নাচ শেষে সেই সুন্দরী রমনী রাজাকে উদ্দেশ্য করে বলল-  ''জাহাপনার আজ্ঞা হলে একটা প্রশ্ন করব''! . রাজাঃ হ্যা ,নিশ্চয় ! . রুপসীঃ উপরওয়ালা যখন সৌন্দর্য দান করছিলেন, তখন আপনি কোথায় ছিলেন? . মজলিসের সকলেই হতবাক। কতবড় দুঃসাহস যে রাজার সৌন্দর্য নিয়ে কটাক্ষ করে ?!! . রাজা একজন সাদাসিদা সুন্দর মনের মানুষ ছিলেন তাই রাগ না করেই মুচকি হেসে জবাব দিলেন, . ''ওহে সুন্দরী, তুমি যখন সৌন্দর্য নেওয়ার লাইনে দাঁড়িয়ে ছিলে, আমি তখন সৌভাগ্যের লাইনে দাঁড়িয়ে সৌভাগ্য নিচ্ছিলাম।  আর আজ দেখো, তোমার মত সুন্দরী আমার গোলাম হয়ে রাজ দরবারে মনোরঞ্জন করতে ব্যস্ত"। . #উপরওয়ালা_সবকিছু_একজনকে_দিয়ে_দেয়নি_কিছু_না_কিছু_অপূর্ণ_রেখেছে।

সাত বলের ওভার: ভুল নাকি অন্য কিছু? কি হল আজকের ম্যাচে!
অনুগল্প : অনুপ্রেরণা  . . সূর্যের প্রখর রৌদ্রে ধুলো উড়িয়ে আনমনে রাস্তায় হেটেই যাচ্ছি। কখন যে রাস্তার মধ্যখানে চলে এসেছিলাম বুঝতেই পারিনি। নিতান্তই ভালো চালক ছিলেন। নয়তো এতক্ষণে হয়তো অনেক দূর চলে যেতাম। ভালোই হতো ! এভাবে বেঁচে থাকার চেয়ে না থাকাটাই শ্রেয়। একটা মানুষ ঠিক কতটুকু চাপ সহ্য করতে পারে ? আজ আমি জীবন যুদ্ধের এক ক্লান্ত সৈনিক। অবসরের পথ খুঁজে খুঁজে আরও ক্লান্ত। তবুও খুঁজে পাইনা।  , এরকম চিন্তা করতে করতে হঠাৎ ফোনটা কেঁপে উঠলো। ওপাশ থেকে, "সজীব, তুই কোথায়?" "এইতো রাস্তায় হেটে হেটে বাড়ি আসছি।" "তারাতারি আস বাবা। সারাদিন না খেয়ে আছিস।" "আচ্ছা মা, চিন্তা করোনা। আসছি।" , সেই সকালে বের হয়েছিলাম না খেয়েই। শুক্রবারে একটা ছাত্র পড়ানোর জন্য তিন কিলোমিটার হেটে আসা যাওয়া করতে হয়। পকেটের ১০ টাকা বাচানোর জন্য জুতো ক্ষয় করে রৌদ্রের প্রখর তাপ সহ্য করাতে অভ্যস্ত হয়েছি অনেক আগেই। মনে হচ্ছে ঘামের দ্বারাই গোসলটা সেরে নেওয়া যাবে। বৃক্ষরোপণের মর্মটা ভালোই বুঝতেছি। কয়েকদিন আগেও রাস্তায় পাশে অনেক বৃক্ষ ছিলো। যার জন্য অনেকটা ছায়া পাওয়া যেত। কিন্তু বৃক্ষগুলো নিধন করা কি এতোই জরুরি ছিলো ! এর উপকারিতা সম্পর্কে আমরা অজ্ঞ।  , আসলে আমরা মানুষ এক ভিন্নধর্মী আজব প্রাণী! সবকিছুতেই উল্টো বুঝার অভ্যাস আমাদের। এই উল্টো বুঝার জন্য প্রতিনিয়ত অনেক সমস্যার সম্মুখীন হতে হয়। ভুলবোঝাবুঝিতে আমরা মানুষ অভ্যস্ত। তাইতো "মানুষ মাত্রই ভুল"। আর এটাই চিরন্তন সত্য। , এই রৌদ্রতাপে আর হাটা সম্ভব হয়। সকালে কিছু না খেয়েই বেরিয়ে পরেছিলাম। এখন প্রায় আড়াইটা বাজে। ক্ষুধার্ত শরীর আর রৌদ্রতাপে খুবই ক্লান্ত। সামনে একটি বৃক্ষ দেখা যাচ্ছে। সেখানে কিছুক্ষণ বসে ক্লান্তি দূর করা যাবে। তবে হেটে আজ আর যাওয়া সম্ভব নয়। কোনো রিকশা এদিকে আসার আগ পর্যন্ত এখানেই বসে থাকবো। , বৃক্ষের নিচে বসে বসে ভাবি, মধ্যবিত্ত হয়ে কেন জন্মালাম। এর চেয়ে নিম্নবিত্ত হওয়া অনেক শ্রেয়। মধ্যবিত্তরা না পারে উচ্চবিত্তের মতো করে মাথা উচুঁ করে বাচতে আবার না পারে নিম্নবিত্তের মতো মাথা নিচু করে অন্যের কাছে হাত পাততে। মধ্যবিত্তদের জীবনটাই ঝুলন্ত!  , বাবা অসুস্থ হওয়ার পর সম্পূর্ণ দায়িত্ব এখন আমার উপর। টিউশনির দ্বারা কি পাঁচ সদস্যের একটি পরিবার চালানো সম্ভব? তবুও তো চালাতে হবে! তার উপর সামনে পরীক্ষা! চাপটা একটু বেশিই হয়ে গেল। হতাশা আর মানষিক চাপ জীবনটাই নষ্ট করে দিচ্ছে। কেউ একজন বলেছেন, "হতাশাগ্রস্থ মানুষের বেচেঁ থাকার অধিকার নেই!" , উল্টোপাল্টা আজগুবি চিন্তা করার সময় হঠাৎ দৃষ্টিগোচর হলো একটা রিকশা এদিকেই আসছে। রিকশার চালক পিচ্চি। আরে এ তো রাজু। বাজারে বিকেলে প্রতিদিন ঘুরাঘুরি করে। অনেক ভালো গান গায়, যার জন্য সবাই তাকে আদর করে। কিন্তু সে পড়াশোনা ছেড়ে রিকশা চালাচ্ছে কেন?  আমার দিকেই আসছে।  "রাজু! তুই আবার কখন থেকে রিকশা চালাতে শুরু করেছিস?" "আইজকা থাইক্কা, কই যাইবেন?" "সামনেই গ্রামের রাস্তা পর্যন্ত। যাবি?" "উঠেন ভাই" "তোর আব্বা কোথায় ?" "মেলা দিন ধইরা অসুখ। ঘরে খাওনের কিচ্ছু নাই। এখন থাইক্কা আমিই রিকশা চালাইমু।" "তোর না সামনে সমাপনী পরীক্ষা?" "হ! রাইত্তে পড়ুম। আর দিনে রিকশা চালাইমু। আমি না চালাইলে কে খাওয়াইবো আমাগো পাঁচ জনরে!" "চলে এসেছি। ভালো করে পড়িস। তোর আত্মবিশ্বাস আমার চেয়েও বেশী। তোকে স্যালুট করতে ইচ্ছা করছে!" "কি যে বলেন ভাই!" "সত্যিই, তোর মতো ছেলে পাওয়া যে কোনো পিতার কাছে ভাগ্যের ব্যাপার!" "দোয়া কইরেন, আমাগো লাগি। আব্বা যেন ভালো হইয়া যান।" "অবশ্যই। আচ্ছা এখন আসি।" , তারপর ভাড়া দিয়ে চলে আসলাম আমার রাস্তায়। বাড়ি পৌছাতে আরও কিছুক্ষণ হাটতে হবে। ইচ্ছা ছিলো ওকে কিছু টাকা দিয়ে সাহায্য করার কিন্তু সামর্থ্য নাই। , আমাদের দেশে কখনোই শিশুশ্রম বন্ধ করা সম্ভব নয়। যেখানেই একটা শিশু পরিবারের একমাত্র উপার্জন কর্তা! সেখানে কিভাবে সম্ভব। আমি নিজেও শিশুশ্রমিক ছিলাম! বাবার সাথে খুব স্কুল জীবন থেকেই ব্যবসার কাজে লেগে যাই। বাবা প্রায়শই অসুস্থ থাকতেন। তাই আমাকেই দোকান সামলাতে হতো ১৩ বছর বয়স থেকেই!  , স্কুলে যখন শিক্ষক ও সহপাঠী জিজ্ঞেস করতো কেন আসি না নিয়মিত,, কত বাহানা দেখাতাম! আমি কতবড় মিথ্যাবাদী, এখন ভাবলেই হাসি পায়। কলেজে উঠার পর থেকে ব্যবসা বন্ধ করে টিউশনি করে পরিবার চালাই। কিন্তু আত্মবিশ্বাস তলানিতে! পঞ্চম শ্রেণীর এক ছাত্র আজ আমার চোখ খুলে দিলো!পিচ্চিটার আত্মবিশ্বাস দেখে নিজের উপর নিজেই লজ্জিত। সে যদি পারে আমি কেন পারবো না! , সূর্যের প্রখর তাপ এখনও আছে। তবে ছেলেটার থেকে যে তাপ আহরণ করেছি, তার তুলনায় খুবই নগন্য। যে বলেছে,"হতাশাগ্রস্থ মানুষের বাঁচার অধিকার নাই!" সে অনেক বড় মিথ্যুক!  তার "অনুপ্রেরণা নেওয়া উচিত এরকম হাজারো রাজুর থেকে!" . লেখা : সজীব সূত্রধর (মৃতকল্প)

[ আচমকা পিছন থেকে একটা মেয়ের কন্ঠস্বর। বুঝতে পারছি না মেয়েটা কে? পরিচিত কেউ হতে পারে। হাত থেকে সিগারেট ফেলে দিলাম। ]  : জ্বি - আপনাকে না আমার চেনা চেনা লাগছে, কিন্তুু মনে করতে পারছি না।    : আমি এখনো বেশ কিছুদূর হাটবো, আপনি চাইলে এর মধ্যে মনে করার চেষ্টা করতে পারেন। - আপনার কন্ঠও আমার চেনা চেনা লাগছে। কিন্তু মনে করতে পারছি না। : ও আচ্ছা।   - আপনি কোথায় যাচ্ছেন? : এখনো কিছু বুঝতে পারছি না, আসলে আমার গন্তব্য কোথায়।  - আপনি কি আমার সাথে মজা করছেন।   : ছি, মজা করবো কেন।   - মজা নয় তো কি। কোথায় যাবেন জানতে চাইলাম। আর প্রতিউত্তরে কি পেলাম।    : সত্যিই আমি জানি না কোথায় যাবো।   - আচ্ছা আপনি এই রোদে হেটে বেড়াচ্ছেন কেন?  : হাটাই যে আমার কাজ।  - কি আশ্চর্য। আমার কেন জানি মনে হচ্ছে আমি আপনার সাথে এর আগেও কথা বলেছি। কিন্তু মনে করতে পারছি না। স্মৃতিশক্তি আমার সাথে বেইমানি করছে।  : ঠিক ধরেছেন। জগতটাই এমন সবাই সবার সাথে বেইমানী করে।     - আচ্ছা আপনার সাথে কে বেইমানি করছে শুনি।   : এই যে কড়া রোদ। আমার হাটতে বেশ অসুবিধা হচ্ছে। রোদ থাকবে মিষ্টি। তার সাথে সাথে একটা মেঘের খন্ড মাথার উপরে থাকবে। আমাকে ছায়া দিবে। ব্যাপারটা সত্যি হলে কেমন হতো বলেন তো। - কি আধ্যাতিক মার্কা কথা বলছেন।   : আমার কাছে প্রতিটা মানুষ ই তার নিজ চরিত্র থেকে আধ্যাতিক।    - আরে আপনি আবির না। ও মাই গড!  আমি এতো দেরিতে চিনলাম। : মাত্র ২:৩০ সেকন্ড সময় নিয়েছেন আপনি। বেশি সময় নেন নি মিস লীজা।  - কেমন আছেন আপনি? : জগত সংসার থেকে যারা দূরে থাকে তারা কখনো খারাপ থাকতে পারে না। ভালই আছি।    - কতদিন পর দেখা। আমার কথা মনে আছে দেখছি। মনে রাখার জন্য ধন্যবাদ।   : ধন্যবাদ দেওয়ার কিছু নাই। কাউকে ভুলে যাওয়া আমার বৈশিষ্ট্যর মধ্যে পড়ে না।   - এজন্যই আপনি হয়তো সবার চেয়ে আলাদা। আমাকে জিঙ্গাসা করবেন না আমি কেমন আছি। নাকি আধ্যাতিক মানুষরা ফর্মালিটি ও বজায় রাখে না।  : জগত সংসারের মানুষ কখনই সুখে থাকতে পারে না। কেননা সুখে থাকা যে বড্ড কঠিন কাজ।  - আচ্ছা।   : আবার কেউ কেউ বলে ভাল আছি। তারা শুধু মাত্র ফর্মালিটির জন্য বলে। আপনার কাছে জানতে চাইলে ২ টি উত্তর পেতাম। হয় ভাল আছি না হয় খারাপ। ভাল আছি বললে ফর্মালিটি রক্ষা করতেন। আর না হয় বলতেন খারাপ আছি। আমার কাছে কাউকে ভাল করার কিংবা ভাল রাখার কোন ক্ষমতাই আল্লাহতালা দেয় নাই। তাই আমার ও খারাপ লাগতো। এজন্য জানতে চাই নি।   - বাহ....! মানুষ এতো সুন্দর করে কথা বলে আপনাকে হয়তো না দেখলে বুঝতেই পারতাম না।   - আচ্ছা আপনি যাচ্ছেন কোথায়?   : আমি সত্যিই জানি না কোথায় যাচ্ছি।   - বলেন তো আপনার সাথে আমার কত দিন পর দেখা? : দুঃখিত! দিনখন হিসাব করা আবিরের কাজ না। তাই বলতে পারছি না। - আচ্ছা আমিই বলি।  : জ্বি,  বলুন।   - প্রায় ১ বছর পর। ঐ দিন আপনি বাস থেকে হঠাৎ নেমে গেলেন কেন।  : বিশ্রাম নেওয়া শেষ হয়ে গেছিলো তাই।  - আপনাকে আমি যতো দেখি ততই অবাক হই।   : আচ্ছা ভাল থাকবেন।   - আরে যাচ্ছেন কোথায়।  : জানি না।  - আচ্ছা চলুন আমরা কোথাও বসে কফি খাই।  : যে ঠোটে নিকোটিনের কালো দাগ ছেয়ে সেখানে যে কফি শোভা পায় না।   - আশ্চর্য।   : আমার কাছে মনে হয়, প্রতিটা মানুষের কাছেই অষ্টম আশ্চর্য বিদ্যমান।  - মাফ চাই, আপনার সাথে আমি কথায় পারবো না। তাহলে আমি কিন্তু ভাগ্যবতী।   : নিজেকে ভাগ্যবতী মনে হওয়ার কারন টা কি জানতে পারি।  - আপনাকে খুজছিলাম। এবং পেয়েও গেছি।  : মন দিয়ে যদি কেউ কিছু চায় তাহলে তা পেয়ে যায়। আল্লাহ কারো ইচ্ছাই অপূর্ণ রাখে না।   - আপনি কখনো কিছু মন দিয়ে চাইছেন।   : আবিরের কোন চাওয়া পাওয়া নেই। মন দিয়ে চাওয়ার তো কোন প্রশ্নই উঠে না।    - অদ্ভুত।   : প্রতিটা মানুষই অদ্ভুত সব চরিত্র নিয়ে জন্মায়।  - আচ্ছা আমার মাঝে অদ্ভুতের কি দেখলেন।    : কারো সাথে কিছুখন কথা বলার পর, তাকে হন্ন হয়ে খোজা মোটেও কি অদ্ভুত কিছু নয় কি?  - জানি না বাপু। আমি খুব রহস্য পছন্দ করি। এবং আপনি আমার কাছে পুরোটাই রহস্যময়ী। আচ্ছা আমি কি আপনার সাথে কিছুখন হাটতে পারি?   : পারেন।  - ধন্যবাদ সাথে নেওয়ার জন্য।   : আমি আপনাকে কই সাথে নিলাম। নিজের পায়ে নিজে হাটবেন। আমাকে একটু সঙ্গ দিবেন।  - বাহ। কবিতাও জানেন দেখছি।  : চলুন, হাটি  .     কড়া রোদের পিচঢালা রাস্তায় এভাবে হেটে চলছি। উদেশ্য জানা নেই। সাথে অপরূপ সুন্দরী রুপসী বালিকা। এতদিন একা একা হেটেছি, কাউকে সাথে নিয়ে হাটার অভিজ্ঞতা ও মন্দ না। লীজা মুগ্ধ হয়ে আমার দিকে তাকিয়ে আছে এবং কথা শুনছে। যখন মুগ্ধ হয়ে কোন মেয়ে কারো দিকে তাকিয়ে থাকে এর চেয়ে সুন্দরতম দৃশ্য আর কি হতে পারে?      লেখা : rabby ahmed ( কাল্পনিক সাহিত্যিক)

বায়জিদ থেকে অক্সিজেন যাওয়ার সময় হঠাৎ খেয়াল করলাম প্রেমিক প্রেমিকা রিক্সার হুট তুলে দিয়েছে বৃষ্টিতে ভিজবে বলে হেব্বি রোমান্স হচ্ছে কিন্তু সে রিক্সায় আরো একজন ভিজছে কিন্তু সে রোমান্টিক হতে পারছে না ! টেনে চলছে ! তার জীবনেও একটি ভালবাসার গল্প আছে ৷ অন্যরকম রোমান্টিকতার গল্প ! . আকাশের গর্জন দেখলে কেউ একজনের মন খারাপ হয় ! বুড়োটার বয়স হয়েছে ! না জানি কোন পথে রিক্সা টানছে কে জানে ! কত করে বলি বৃষ্টি আসলে রিক্সা চালানোর দরকার নেই ! বদমাইশ বেটা ! কথা শুনে না ! . অক্সিজেন থেকে চট্টগ্রাম বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় আসার সময় একটি সিএনজিতে উঠলাম ৷ চালককে বার বার কে যেন ফোন করছে ! সে রেগে গিয়ে বললো, 'ওডি তোরে কইছিনা গাড়ি চালাচ্ছি ! এতোবার ফোন দেস কেন ! তাড়াতাড়ি চলে আসলে খাবি কি !' এটা কি ভালবাসার গল্পে পড়বে ? . চট্টগ্রাম বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় ঢুকার সময় একটি ভালবাসার গল্প খুঁজছিলাম ! সিএনজিতে পাশে এক মেয়ে উঠার কারণে আমাকে সামনে যেতে হলো ড্রাইভারের পাশে কিন্তু সিট ভিজা থাকার কারণে পাছা ভিজে যাচ্ছিলো কি দরকার ছিলো সেক্রিপাইস করে এমন একটি গল্প তৈরী করার ! . ভিজা নিতম্ব দেখলে অনেকে মনে করে খাইছেরে কাম সাইরা দিছে মনে হয় গুরু ! সেই লজ্জায় দৌড়ে নেমে অন্ধকার পথে যাওয়ার আগেই পিছন থেকে মিষ্টি কন্ঠ ভেসে আসলো ভাইয়া এটা মনে হয় আপনার ছাতি ? ধন্যবাদ দিয়ে মনে মনে বললাম, দুই জইন্যা এতো বড় ছাতি কি পাশে নিয়ে চলা যায় তাই ভুলে রেখে যাচ্ছিলাম ! মেয়েটি মনে হয় হাতি শুনেছিলো ! তার নিজের সাথে মিলিয়ে একটি দুই লাইনের ইতিহাস বলেছিলো.....! আমি দুইজইন্যা হাতি.....! . চট্টগ্রাম বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় উত্তর ক্যাম্পাস শোভাকলোণিতে আমার বাসা হওয়ায় সব বৃষ্টি ভেজা ভালবাসার গল্পের এখানেই সমাপ্তি হয় ! একটু বৃষ্টি হলেই রাস্তায় পানি উঠে যায় ! তবুও আরো একটি ভালবাসার গল্প না বললে অপূর্ণতা থেকে যাবে ৷ . পছন্ড বৃষ্টি হচ্ছিলো সেদিন ! কোথাও কেউ নেই ৷ রাস্তায় এক হাটু পানি ৷ মেয়েটির প্রসব বেদনা উঠেছিলো ! দাইমা দিয়ে কিছু হচ্ছিলো না ! স্বামী কাউকে না পেয়ে একটি পরিত্যাক্ত ভ্যানে নিজের স্ত্রী'কে প্লাস্টিক মুড়ি দিয়ে টেনে টেনে পাশের একটি হাসপাতালে নিয়ে গেলো ! অনেকক্ষণ পর তার একটি মেয়ে সন্তান হলো ততক্ষণে মেয়েটির মা আর পৃথিবীতে নেই ! বাবা পরে মেয়েটির নাম রেখেছিলো 'বৃষ্টি !' . কাল বৃষ্টির বিয়ে.... তার বাবা আজ মহাব্যস্ত ! পরশু প্লিজ এক টুকরো মেঘের বদলে তুমি রোদ নিয়ে এসো ! . চোখের জল বৃষ্টিতে ভিজে যায় কিন্তু রোদে শুকিয়ে গেলে স্মৃতি রেখে যায় ! স্মৃতিটুকু না থাকলে তরশু সে কি নিয়ে বাঁচবে ! . লিখেছেন, abdur rob sharif

📝গল্প: একটি কবিতা . . মেয়েটা ছেলেটাকে চারটি অপশন দিয়ে জিজ্ঞেস করলো, বলোতো আমি কেমন? ১. বোকা। ২. খুব বোকা। ৩. বুদ্ধিমান। ৪. খুব বুদ্ধিমান। খানিক সময় পর ছেলেটা জবাব দিলো, তুই খুব বেশী বুদ্ধিমান। মেয়েটা অবাক হয়ে বললো, ‘কেন?! কেন এমনটা মনে হলো?’  ‘‘আমি তোর কয়বছরের সিনিয়র?’’ ‘‘মাত্র ছয় বছরের!’’ ‘‘এটা তোর কাছে মাত্র?!” “হুম। কারণ তুমি বিয়ে করবে ৫/৬বছর পর! তখন আমিই হয়ে যাব বিয়ের পাত্রী! তাহলে এতো সিনিয়র হয়ে তোমার লাভটা কি?!” বলেই খিলখিল করে হাসছে নিতু। ফাহাদ অবাক হয়ে তার হাসি দেখছে। ক্লাস সেভেনে পড়ুয়া একটা মেয়ে এতো সুন্দর করে হাসবে, এটা ঠিক না। তাকে আরো বড় হয়ে হাসতে হবে।  ধুরর হাসির সাথে বয়সের কি সম্পর্ক! ব্যাপারটা ঝেড়ে ফাহাদ নিতুকে বললো, ‘এবার বুঝতে পারছিস, তোকে কেন এতো চালাক বলছি?!’ নিতু কিছু বললো না। সে ফাহাদের কথা এড়িয়ে গিয়ে বললো, ‘ফাহাদ ভাইয়া, শুনেছি তুমি খুব ভালো কবিতা লিখ। আমাকে একটা কবিতা লিখে দিবে?’ “তোকে কে বলছে আমি কবিতা লিখি?” “তোমার বোন নুসরাত।” “ও মিথ্যে বলেছে?!!!” নিতু মুচকি মুচকি হাসছে। ফাহাদ জিজ্ঞেস করলো, ‘কিরে হাসছিস কেন?’ নিতু বললো, ‘আমি গতকাল তোমার রুমে গিয়ে.....!’ - কি? “ডায়রী খুলে তোমার লেখা কবিতাগুলো পড়ে এসেছি।” ফাহাদ রাগের ভাব করে বললো, ‘কিহ্ তোর এত্তো বড় সাহস?!!’ নিতু বললো ‘সরি ভাইয়া।’ বলেই সে হন হন করে হেঁটে চলে গেছে।  . ফাহাদ মনে মনে হাসছে। বয়সের বিশাল ফারাক থাকাসত্ত্বেও নীতুকে তার অসম্ভব ভালো লাগে। শুধু যে ভালো লাগে তা না। পছন্দও করে। কিন্তু এটা প্রকাশ করা যাবে না। তার দুইটা কারণ আছে, একটা হলো নিতু তার ছোট বোনের বান্ধবী আর দ্বিতীয়তো মেয়েটার বয়স কম। অল্পবয়সী মেয়েদের আবেগ বেশী। আবেগ দিয়ে তারা যেকোনো অঘটন ঘটিয়ে ফেলতে পারে। . . পরদিন সকালে ফাহাদের আব্বু রফিক সাহেব এসে বললেন, ‘ফাহাদ তোমার পরীক্ষা তো রবিবার থেকে শুরু, তাই না?’ “হ্যা আব্বু।” “ভার্সিটির পাশেই তোমার জন্য বাসা ঠিক করে রাখা হয়েছে। তুমি শনিবার সকালেই ঢাকা চলে যাও। আর এই নাও তিস্তা এক্সপ্রেস ট্রেনের ফাস্টক্লাস টিকেট।” রফিক সাহেব পুত্রের হাতে টিকেট ধরিয়ে দিয়ে নিজের রুমে চলে গেলেন। ফাহাদ টিকেট হাতে অসহায় ভঙ্গিতে দাঁড়িয়ে আছে। খনিকের জন্য তাকে ভিক্ষুক মনে হচ্ছে। ভিক্ষুক ফাহাদ সাহেব। . ফাহাদের ঢাকা শহর একদম ভালো লাগে না। ঢাকা শহরের আকাশে ছড়িয়ে ছিটিয়ে থাকা জোৎস্নাগুলোকেও তার কৃত্রিম মনেহয়। চাঁদটাকে মনেহয় নাসার বিজ্ঞানীরা বড় ধরণের কোনো একটা থালা বাঁকা করে টাঙিয়ে রেখেছে। সবচেয়ে বড় কথা হলো ঢাকা শহরে নিতুর মতো কোনো মেয়ে নেই। সবগুলো মেয়েই খুব সুন্দর। কিন্তু নিতুর মত অমায়িক না। নিতুর মধ্যে কেমন যেন একটা মায়া আছে। একটা ঘোর লাগানো টান আছে। . . শনিবার সকালে নাস্তা সেরে কাঁধে ব্যাগ ঝুলিয়ে ফাহাদ রেলস্টেশনের দিকে হেঁটে যাচ্ছে। মাঝপথে নিতুর সাথে দেখা। সে যাচ্ছে প্রাইভেটে।  “ফাহাদ ভাই এতো সকালে কাঁধে ব্যাগ ঝুলিয়ে কোথায় যাও?” “ঢাকা চলে যাচ্ছিরে নিতু।” “কোনদিন আসবা?” “ মাস তিনেকের আগে আর আসা হবে না।” এই কথাটা শুনার সাথে সাথে নিতুর মনের মধ্য দিয়ে একটা কম্পন বয়ে গেলো। ভূমির উপর দিয়ে হলে তার মাত্রা হতো ৭.৫!  ফাহাদ নিতুর মুখের দিকে তাকাতেই দেখে মেয়েটার চোখে জল। “কিরে নিতু তুই কাঁদছিস কেন?” “একটু কষ্ট হচ্ছে।” “কেন?”  “তুমি চলে গেলে আমি কার সাথে কথা বলবো! কে আমাকে তোমার মত প্রশ্রয় দিবে!” “নিতু.....!” “হু।” “তুই আমাকে পছন্দ করিস?” “তুমি বুঝো না?” এমন সময় ট্রেনের হর্ন বেজে উঠলো। ফাহাদ প্যান্টের পকেট থেকে একটা কাগজ বের করে নিতুর হাতে দিলো। “নিতু এই নে, তোর জন্য লেখা কবিতা।” নিতু কাগজটা খুলে পড়তে লাগলো,  “কোনো একদিন ক্লান্তহীন মধ্যদুপুরে, যদি হুট করে এসে দেখি তুমি নেই! তবে আমি চিৎকার করে তোমাকে ডাকবো, দিশাহীন পাগলের মত তোমায় খুঁজবো, আমার জীবনের শেষ মুহূর্ত পর্যন্ত.....!” কবিতাটা পড়ে নিতু মাথা তুলে স্টেশনের দিকে তাকালো। ট্রেন ততক্ষনে চোখের আড়ালে চলে গেছে।  . . 👉লেখা: akram hussain tahosin

একটি শিক্ষণীয় গল্প,, এক ভদ্রমহিলা একটা অজগর সাপ পুষতো। সাপটাও মহিলাকে অসম্ভব ভালোবাসতো। অজগরটা লম্বা ৪ মিটার এবং দেখতে ও বেশ স্বাস্হ্যবান ছিলো । . একদিন হঠাৎ করে মহিলার আদরের সাপটি খাওয়া দাওয়া বন্ধ করে দিলো। কয়েক সপ্তাহ চলে গেলো কিন্তু সাপটি কিছুই খায় না। আদরের সাপের এমন অবস্থায় মহিলা় দুশ্চিন্তায় পড়ে গেলো এবং উপায় না পেয়ে অবশেষে সাপটাকে ডাক্তারে কাছে নিয়ে গেলো। . ডাক্তার সাহেব মনযোগ দিয়ে সব শুনলেন, এবং মহিলাকে ডাক্তার প্রশ্ন করলেন, "সাপটা কি রাতে আপনার সাথে ঘুমায়?" মহিলা উত্তর দিলেন ,"হ্যাঁ"। ডাক্তার আবার মহিলা কে প্রশ্ন করলেন, "ঘুমানোর সময় সাপটা আস্তে আস্তে আপনাকে চারপাশে জড়িয়ে ধরে?" . মহিলা বিস্মিত হলেন এবং জবাব দিলেন, "হ্যাঁ"। এইবার চিকিৎসক খুবই ভয়ানক এবং অপ্রত্যাশিত কিছু বললেন। ডাক্তার বললেন, ম্যাডাম সাপটি জড়িয়ে ধরে আপনাকে চারপাশ থেকে মুড়িয়ে ধরে কারণ সে আপনার মাপ নিচ্ছে এবং . নিজেকে প্রস্তুত করছে কিভাবে আপনাকে আক্রমন করা যায়। সাপটি এ জন্যই খাওয়া দাওয়া বন্ধ করেছে যাতে পেটে যথেষ্ট জায়গা খালি হয় এবং আপনাকে খেয়ে সেই জায়গা পূরুন করতে পারে এবং আপনাকে সহজেই হজম করতে পারে। . moral of the story "আপনার চারপাশে হয়তো এমন অনেকেই আছে যাদের আপনি কাছের মানুষ ভাবেন যাদের দেখে মনে হয় আপনাকে তারা অসম্ভব ভালবাসে। হয়তো আপনার ক্ষতিই তাদের প্রধান উদ্দেশ্য।"
লেখা : farhan ahmed farabi (সামরিক লেখক) :প্রিয় সিনথিয়া শহরটা জুড়ে এখন নীরবতা, ঘুমিয়ে আছে সব পাখি, ঘুমিয়ে গেছে ফারদিন আর ফারদিনাও। মাঝেমাঝে অদ্ভুত কিছু দেখেই হয়তো চেঁচামেঁচি করছে পথের কুকুরেরা। আর শুধু এই রাতটিই, এই রাতই পোহানোর অপেক্ষা। নিজেকে বাংলার বাঘ প্রমাণ করতে উদগ্রীব হয়ে আছে সমস্ত রেজিমেন্ট। যুদ্ধ বিমানে আর্মামেড লোড করে হয়তো আকাশপানে চেয়ে আছে যুদ্ধ বিমানের পাইলটেরা! নাবিকেরা হয়তো ম্যাসিন-গান ও কামান তাক করে রেখেছে সাগর সীমার দিকে। সাথে আমিও, বিভোর হয়ে আছি যুদ্ধের আশায়। আমি নিষ্ঠুর, আমি স্বার্থপর! তোমাদের কথা না ভেবে দেশের কথা ভাবছি! আমি মারা গেলে তোমাদের কি হবে, সে কথা ভাবারও সময় আমার কাছে নেই! ফারদিনের সাথে খেলনার সৈনিক দিয়ে কত খেলতাম, আজ সেই খেলনার সৈনিক আমি। বার্মিজ বাহিনী বোমা ফেলে ধ্বংস করে দিবে আমাদের সবকিছু! আমি কখনোই ক্ষমা করনো না, কখনোই না। আমায় ক্ষমা করো সিনথিয়া, তোমার কথার অবাধ্য হই বলে। তুমি হাজার কাঁদলেও ফিরেতাকাতে পারছি না তোমার দিকে। যদি আমি ফিরে আসি, তবে আমি কথা দিচ্ছি, কখনোই তোমার একটা কথারও অবাধ্য হবোনা। কাল আমি যুদ্ধে যাবো! বার্মিজদের জ্বালিয়ে পুড়িয়ে ছারখার করে ফেলবো! তুমি চাইতে, যেন আমি একজন সাহসী অফিসার হই। কাল আমি সেই সাহসীকতার পরিচয় দিতে যাচ্ছি! তাদের কোনো চিহ্নও রাখবো না আমার দেশে। দলের সবার আগে শত্রুর অস্ত্রের সামনে বুক পাতবো। আমি ভয় পাইনা, ভয় পাইনা অস্ত্র, ভয় পাইনা বোমা! ক্ষমা করো সিনথিয়া, ক্ষমা করো এই অতৃপ্ত যোদ্ধাকে! ইতি তোমার ফারাবী collected

সুরা আল-বাকারাহ /৪৮ -------------------------------------------- "আর তোমরা সে দিনকে ভয় কর, যেদিন কেউ কারো কোন কাজে আসবে না। আর কারো পক্ষ থেকে কোন সুপারিশ গ্রহণ করা হবে না এবং কারও কাছ থেকে কোন বিনিময় নেয়া হবে না। আর তারা সাহায্যপ্রাপ্তও হবে না।"" তাফসির :- -------------------------------- আর তোমরা সে দিনের তাকওয়া অবলম্বন করো যেদিন কেউ কার কোন কাজে আসবে না [১]। আর কারও সুপারিশ গ্রহন করা হবে না [২] এবং কার কাছ থেকে বিনিময় গৃহীত হবে না। আর তারা সাহায্যও প্রাপ্ত হবে না [৩]। [১] অর্থাৎ কেউ অপর কারও পক্ষ থেকে কোন কিছু আদায় করবে না। [তাবারী] তাকওয়া অবলম্বন কর এবং ভয় কর সে দিনকে, যখন কোন পিতা তার সন্তানের পক্ষ থেকে কিছু আদায় করবে না, অনুরূপ কোন সন্তান সেও তার পিতার পক্ষ থেকে আদায়কারী হবে না" [সূরা লুকমান ৩৩] তাছাড়া হাদীসেও এসেছে, রাসূলুল্লাহ সাল্লাল্লাহু আলাইহি ওয়া সাল্লাম বলেছেন, “আল্লাহ ঐ বান্দাকে রহমত করুন, যার কাছে তার কোন ভাইয়ের কোন ইযযত আবরুর উপর হামলা জনিত যুলুম, অথবা তার সম্পদ ও সম্মানের উপর আঘাত ছিল, তারপর সে সেটা থেকে নিজেকে বিমুক্ত করতে পেরেছে, ঐ দিনের পূর্বেই যে দিন কোন দীনার বা দিরহাম থাকবে না। বরং যদি তার কোন নেকী থাকে তবে তা থেকে তা নিয়ে যাওয়া হবে। আর যদি নেকী না থাকে তবে তার উপর মাযমুমের পাপসমূহ চাপিয়ে দেয়া হবে। " [বুখারী: ৬৫৩৪] [২] আয়াত থেকে বাহ্যতঃ বোঝা যাচ্ছে যে, আখেরাতে শাফা’আত বা সুপারিশ কোন কাজে আসবে না। মূলত: ব্যাপারটি এরকম নয়। এ আয়াতের উদ্দেশ্য শুধু কাফের, মুশরিক, আহলে কিতাব ও মুনাফিকদের জন্য কোন শাফা’আত বা সুপারিশ কাজে আসবে না। যেমন পবিত্র কুরআনের অন্যত্র বলা হয়েছে, “আর আল্লাহ যার উপর সন্তুষ্ট নয় তার জন্য তারা সুপারিশ করবে না"। [সূরা আল- আম্বিয়া: ২৮] আল্লাহ কাদের উপর সন্তুষ্ট নয় তা আল্লাহ নিজেই ঘোষণা করে বলেছেন, “আর আল্লাহ তাঁর বান্দাদের কুফরীতে সন্তুষ্ট নন। ” [সূরা আয-যুমার:৭] সুতরাং কাফেরদের জন্য কোন সুপারিশ নয়। আর কাফেররাও হাশরের দিন স্বীকৃতি দিবে যে, তাদের জন্য কোন সুপারিশকারী নেই, তারা বলবে “আমাদের তো কোন সুপারিশকারী নেই” [সূরা আশ-শু'আরা: ১০০] তাদের সম্পর্কে আল্লাহ নিজেও বলেছেন, “সুতরাং কোন সুপারিশকারীর সুপারিশ তাদের কোন উপকার দিবে না”। [সূরা আল-মুদাসসির:৪৮] এতে স্পষ্ট হয়ে গেল যে, যারা কুফরী, শিরকি , নিফাকী অবস্থায় মারা যাবে তাদের জন্য কোন শাফা’আত বা সুপারিশ নেই। পক্ষান্তরে মুমিনদের জন্য শাফা’আত বা সুপারিশ অবশ্যই হবে। যা কুরআন, সুন্নাহ ও উম্মতের ইজমা দ্বারা প্রমাণিত। কিন্তু তাদের জন্য সুপারিশের ব্যাপারেও শর্ত হচ্ছে, তন্মধ্যে প্রথম শর্ত হচ্ছে, তাদের মধ্যে ঈমান অবশিষ্ট থাকতে হবে। মূলত: এ ঈমানের কারণেই শাফা’আত তথা সুপারিশের হকদার হয়েছে। যার সামান্যতম ঈমান আছে তার উপর আল্লাহর সামান্যতম সন্তুষ্টি অবশিষ্ট আছে। সুতরাং যার জন্য সুপারিশ করা হবে, তার জন্য আল্লাহর সামান্যতম সন্তুষ্টি হলেও থাকতে হবে। যদিও অন্য অপরাধের কারণে সে জাহান্নাম থেকে মুক্তি পেতে পারে নি। দ্বিতীয় শর্ত হচ্ছে, শাফা’আত বা সুপারিশ করার জন্য আল্লাহর কাছ থেকে অনুমতি থাকতে হবে। আল্লাহ বলেন, “এমন কে আছে যে, তাঁর অনুমতি ব্যতীত তাঁর কাছে সুপারিশ করে?” [সূরা আল-বাকারাহ:২৫৫] তৃতীয় শর্ত হচ্ছে, যিনি সুপারিশ করবেন তার উপরও আল্লাহ্ তা'আলার সন্তুষ্টি থাকতে হবে। আল্লাহ বলেন, “আর আসমানসমূহে বহু ফিরিশতা রয়েছে; তাদের সুপারিশ কিছুমাত্র ফলপ্রসূ হবে না, তবে আল্লাহর অনুমতির পর; যার জন্য তিনি ইচ্ছে করেন ও যার প্রতি তিনি সন্তুষ্ট" [সূরা আন-নাজম: ২৬] অর্থাৎ যিনি সুপারিশ করবেন তার কথা-বার্তা ও সুপারিশ আল্লাহর মনঃপুত হতে হবে। মহান আল্লাহ বলেন, “দয়াময় যাকে অনুমতি দেবেন ও যার কথা তিনি পছন্দ করবেন সে ছাড়া কারো সুপারিশ সেদিন কোন কাজে আসবে না" [সূরা ত্বা-হাঃ ১০৯] এ তিনটি শর্ত পাওয়া যাওয়া সাপেক্ষে নবী-রাসূল, শহীদগণ ও নেককার মুমিনগণ শাফা'আত বা সুপারিশ করবেন। যা বহু হাদীস দ্বারাও প্রমাণিত। [৩] আলোচ্য আয়াতে যেদিনের কথা বলা হয়েছে, সেটি হলো কেয়ামতের দিন। সাধারণতঃ মানুষের কোন শাস্তির হুকুম হলে তা থেকে বাচার জন্য মানুষ নিম্নলিখিত চারটি উপায় অবলম্বন করেঃ ১) একজনের পরিবর্তে অন্যজন স্বতঃস্ফূর্তভাবে শাস্তি ভোগ করে। আল্লাহ্ তাআলা এখানে "কেউ কারো পক্ষ থেকে আদায় করে না” বলে কেয়ামতের দিন এমন কিছু ঘটার সম্ভাবনা নাকচ করে দেন। ২) অথবা, একজনের জন্য অপরজন সুপারিশ করে শাস্তি থেকে মুক্তির ব্যবস্থা করে। আল্লাহ্ তা'আলা এ সম্ভাবনাও নাকচ করে বলেনঃ “কারো সুপারিশ গ্রহণ করা হবে না”। ৩) অথবা, বিনিময় আদায়ের মাধ্যমে কেউ কেউ শাস্তি থেকে মুক্তি পেতে চায়। সে বিনিময় দু'ধরনের হতে পারে, ক) অন্যের কাছ থেকে কিছু সওয়াব লাভ করে তার বিনিময়ে মুক্তির ব্যবস্থা করা। খ) টাকা-পয়সা ইত্যাদির বিনিময়ে মুক্তির ব্যবস্থা করা। আল্লাহ্ তা'আলা “কারো কাছ থেকে বিনিময় গৃহীত হবে না", এ কথা বলে এমন সম্ভাবনাও নাকচ করে দিয়েছেন। ৪) অথবা, শাস্তির হুকুমের বিপরীতে অপরাধীকে সাহায্যকারী দল থাকে, যারা তাকে তা না মানতে বা তার শাস্তি লাঘব করতে সাহায্য করে থাকে আল্লাহ তা'আলা “আর তারা কোন প্রকার সাহায্যপ্রাপ্তও হবে না” এ কথা দ্বারা এমন সম্ভাবনা উড়িয়ে দিয়েছেন। এর কারণ হচ্ছে, তারা ঈমান আনেনি। কিন্তু যদি তাদের ঈমান থাকত তবে শর্তসাপেক্ষে এ চারটির কোন কোনটি কাজে আসত মোটকথা, দুনিয়াতে সাহায্য করার যত পদ্ধতি আছে ঈমান ব্যতীত আখেরাতে সেগুলোর কোনটাই কার্যকর হবে না।

ভালোবাসাটা এমন হওয়া উচিত আমরা জেনো আমাদের ভালোবাসার মানুষের সুখে থাকার কারন হতে পারি বা তাকে সুখে রাখতে পারি! . কিন্তু বেশির ভাগ ক্ষেত্রেই হয় তার উল্টোটা! সম্পর্কটা যেভাবেই শুরু হোক তার পরেই শুরু হয়ে যায় অশান্তি আর অবহেলা! . বেশির ভাগ সম্পর্কই মাঝ পথে শেষ হয়ে যায়! যারা আমাদের সুখে রাখার কথা দিয়ে শুরু করেছিলো সম্পর্ক তারাই আমাদেরকে কষ্ট দিয়ে মাঝ পথে হাত ছেড়ে চলে যায়! . আর না হয় আমরা যাদের সুখে রাখার কথা দিয়েছিলাম, আমরা মাঝ পথে তাকে ছেড়ে চলে আসি! কিন্তু ভালোবাসা তো হলো আমাদের ভালোবাসার মানুষকে সুখে রাখা বা তার পাশে থেকে তার মুখে হাসি ফোটানো! আমরা কি তা পারি?? . না, পারি না! তবে কেনো একজনকে মিছে স্বপ্ন দেখাই?? এই ভালো রাখার কারন প্রমিক-প্রেমিকা ছাড়াও এটা সংসার জীবনেও হতে পারে!  বেশির ছেলেই তার বাবা মার সাথে থাকতে চায়! কারন ছেলেটা জানে তার বাবা মা কত কষ্ট করে এত বড় করেছে! কিন্তু ২ বছর সংসার জীবন পার করেই মেয়েরা চায় ছেলেরা তার বাবা মা ছেড়ে আলাদা সংসার করুক! কিন্তু ভালো বাসা তো বলে ভালোবাসার মানুষকে সুখে রাখা! . ছেলেটি যদি তার বাবা মাকে সাথে রেখে সুখী হতে পারে,তাহলে সেই মেয়েটিরও উচিত ছেলেটির সুখে সুখী হওয়া! কিন্তু বেশিরভাগ মেয়েই তা চায় না! . তাহলে কি আমরা ভালোবাসার মানুষকে আসলেই সুখে রাখতে পারছিনা? যদি সুখে রাখতে না পারি তাহলে আমরা কেমনে সুখে থাকবো??পৃথিবীতে ভালোবাসার মানুষটি যদি সুখে না থাকে তাহলে আমাদের সুখে থাকা সম্ভব না! . আর ভালোবাসার মানুষটি সুখে না থাকার ফলেও যদি আমরা সুখী হতে পারি, তবে সেটা ভালোবাসা নয়!  আর যেখানে ভালোবাসা নেই সেখানে একটা সম্পর্ক বেশি দূর যাবে না এটাই স্বাভাবিক!  তাই যদি কাউকে ভালোবাসেন তাহলে তার সুখে থাকার কারন হওয়ার চেষ্টা করুন, আর না হয় তাকে ছেড়ে দিন.. তাকে মিথ্যে স্বপ্ন দেখিয়ে ঝুলিয়ে রাখবেন না, কারন ভালোবাসা যেখানে থাকবে না,সেই সম্পর্ক একদিন না একদিন ভাঙবেই! . ----লেখা:ইয়াসিন আরাফাত শাওন(কালো ছেলে)

প্রথমবার সুইসাইড করতে গিয়ে ফিরে আসার পর মেয়েটি ছেলেটিকে বললো কি ব্যাপার সুইসাইড করতে গিয়ে ফিরে আসলে যে আবার ? 'সুইসাইড করতে যাবো এমন সময় মনে হলো ফেসবুক ওয়ালটা অনলি মি করা তাই পাবলিক করতে আসলাম !' . দ্বিতীয়বার সুইসাইড করতে গিয়ে ফিরে আসার পর মেয়েটি বললো জানতাম ! তোমার মতো কাপুরুষের দ্বারা মশা মারাও সম্ভব না ! আবার সুইসাইড ! 'ইয়ে মানে একটি সুইসাইড নোট লিখে স্ট্যাটাস দিতে ভুলে গেছিলাম ! লিখে এক্ষুণি যাবো !' . তৃতীয়বার সুইসাইড করতে গিয়ে ফিরে আসার পর মেয়েটি আবারো জিজ্ঞেস করলো কি রে বাপ এখনো সুইসাইড করোনি ! তবে কেনো ? 'সুইসাইড করতে যাবো এমন সময় মনে হলো সুইসাইড স্ট্যাটাসটি একটু চেক করে আসি ৷ কয়টা লাইক পড়ছে একটু দেখে আসি তারপর....!' . চতুর্থবার সুইসাইড করতে গিয়ে সে আবারো ফিরে আসলো ! মেয়েটি এবার তিক্ত বিরক্ত হয়ে জিজ্ঞেস করলো আমি জানতাম তুমি পারবে না ! 'আসলে ঐ স্ট্যাটাসে এক হাজার লাইক না আসলে সুইসাইড করবো না !' . স্ট্যাটাসে এক হাজার লাইক আসলো . ছেলেটি আবারো সুইসাইড করতে যাবে এমন সময় মেয়েটি ডাক দিলো ! ছেলেটি মনে করেছে মেয়েটি হয়তো তাকে বাঁধা দিয়ে বলবে মাই সুইট জান তুমি মরে গেলে আমার কি হপে চান্দু এমন কিছু একটা ! তাই এক লাফ দিয়ে চেয়ার থেকে নেমে দৌড়ে মেয়েটির কাছে গেলো ! মেয়েটি বললো, 'সুইসাইড নোটে আমার নাম নেই কেনো ! আমারও সেলেব্রেটি হওয়ার শখ আছে তুমি মরে যাওয়ার পর...!' . ছেলেটি মেয়েটির নাম যোগ করে আরেকটা স্ট্যাটাস দিয়ে ফাইনালি আত্মহত্যা করতে গেলো ! . কিছুক্ষণ পর আবার ফিরে আসলো ছেলেটি ! মেয়েটি বললো তুমি এবারও পারলে না ! আমি জানতাম এমন লেডিস মার্কা ছেলের দ্বারা প্রেম তো দূরের কথা কোন কিছুই সম্ভব না ! . অপমানে ছেলেটি আবার আত্মহত্যা করতে গেলো কিন্তু না এবারও ফেরত আসলো ! মেয়েটি নির্বাক ! . ছেলেটি এবার বললো, 'এতোবার আত্মহত্যা করতে যাওয়া দেখার পর যে মেয়েটি একবারও বারণ করলো না খাইলাম না তার ভালবাসা ! তারপর মেয়েটির পাছায় একটি লাথি দিয়া চলে আসলো !' . এরপর ছেলেটিকে দেখলাম চট্টগ্রাম বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় এক নং গেইট মামুর দোকানে বইস্সা বিন্দাস বেনসন টানছে !

১৭তম কিউবার রাষ্ট্রপতি এবং কমিউনিস্ট পার্টি কেন্দ্রীয় কমিটির প্রথম সচিব বিপ্লবী নেতা ফিদেল ক্যাস্ত্রো বলেছিলেন,'মৃত্যুর পর কোথাও যেনো তার মূর্তি এবং ছবি টাঙ্গানো যেনো না হয়!' কিউবাবাসী সেই কথা রেখেছিলেন কারণ ফিদেল ক্যাস্ত্রো আরো বলেছিলেন, তার একমাত্র জায়গা মানুষ হৃদয়ে তিনি শুধু সেখানে থাকতে রাজি আর কোথাও না!.ফিদেল কাস্ত্রোর যখন বিচার চলছিলো তখন তিনি একটা কথা বলছিলেন,'আমাকে অপরাধী বানাতে পারো, এটা কোনো গুরুত্ব বহন করেনা। ইতিহাস আমাকে মুক্তি দেবে'.সোজা কথা এটা! ইতিহাস নির্ধারণ করে দিবে কে ভালো কাজ করেছে আরকে খারাপ কাজ করেছে!.আমি মূর্তিতে বিশ্বাস করিনা! আবার যারা বিশ্বাস করে তাদের হৃদয়ে আঘাতও করতে চাই না!.শুধু বিশ্বাস করি এই হৃদয়ে আল্লাহ নামে একজন সৃষ্টিকর্তা বসবাস করেন! হৃদয়ের বাহিরে তাকে রাখার জন্য আর কোন জায়গা নেই.ক্যাস্ত্রো বলছিলেন, আমি হিমালয় দেখিনি বঙ্গবন্ধুকে দেখেছি!বঙ্গবন্ধুর দেশে তার কন্যার আমলে আমি এসব অসঙ্গতি মেনে নিতে পারিনা!.আমি বঙ্গবন্ধুকে হৃদয়ে রাখবো না দেয়ালে টাঙ্গিয়ে রাখবো তা কেউ নির্ধারণ করে দিতে পারে না তেমনি হৃদয়ে না রেখে দেয়ালে টাঙ্গালে সেটা কি প্রকৃত শ্রদ্ধা হয়?.আমি আমার বাবা মায়ের ছবি আমার বেডরুমে ঝুলিয়ে রাখিনি বলে কি আমি ওদের ভালবাসি না?.রবীন্দ্রনাথ বলেছিলেন, ভালবাসার জন্য আমাকে একটু অবসর দাও! কঠিন কথা! তেমনি স্বাধীনতা দেওয়া লাগে মন কে!.নোবেল বিজয়ী উইলিবান্ট বলেছিলেন, 'মুজিব হত্যার পর বাঙালীদেরআর বিশ্বাসকরা যায় না,যারা মুজিবকে হত্যা করেছে তারা যেকোন জঘন্য কাজ করতে পারে!'.সুতরাং ছবি টাঙ্গায়ে তাদের হৃদয় ধোলাই করা যাবে না.এভাবে ধোলাই করতে হয়,'সাত কোটি বাঙ্গালির ভালোবাসার কাঙ্গাল আমি। আমি সব হারাতে পারি, কিন্তু বাংলাদেশের মানুষের ভালোবাসা হারাতে পারব না।'.ভালবাসা হৃদয়ে থাকে মূর্তিতে না.....! তোমরা যদি মূর্তিতে ভালবাসা খুঁজে পাও তাতে বাধা দেওয়ার অধিকার আমার নেই! সবার মতের প্রতি শ্রদ্ধা দেখানো হলো প্রকৃত মানুষ্যত্ব!.

প্রশ্ন   : ব্যবসার ক্ষেত্রে সামান্য মিথ্যা বলা যাবে কি? যেমন কোন পণ্য ৫০ টাকা দিয়ে কেনা থাকলেও বিক্রি করার সময় ১০০ টাকার উপরে কেনা আছে এরূপ বলা যাবে কি?  -----  উত্তর : এরূপ মিথ্যা বলা যাবে না। যে তিন শ্রেণীর লোকের সাথে আল্ললাহ ক্বিয়ামতের দিন কথা বলবেন না, তাদের প্রতি দৃষ্টি দিবেন না এবং তাদেরকে পবিত্রও  করবেন না।  তাদের মধ্যে অন্যতম হ’ল ঐ ব্যবসায়ী, যে মিথ্যা শপথ করে তার পণ্য বিক্রি করে’ (মুসলিম হা/১০৫, মিশকাত হা/২৭৯৫)। রাসূল (ছাঃ) বলেন, হে ব্যবসায়ীর দল! তোমরা মিথ্যা কথা থেকে  বেঁচে থাকো (ত্বাবারাণী, ছহীহুত তারগীব হা/১৭৯৩)। তিনি বলেন, ‘হে ব্যবসায়ী সম্প্রদায়! ব্যবসাকার্যে বাজে কথা এবং অপ্রয়োজনে কসম করা হয়ে থাকে। তাই ছাদাক্বা দ্বারা তোমরা তার প্রায়শ্চিত্ত কর’ (তিরমিযী; মিশকাত হা/২৭৯৮)। তিনি বলেন, মিথ্যা পাপের পথ দেখায়। আর পাপ জাহান্নামের পথ প্রদর্শন করে’ (মুত্তাফাক্ব আলাইহ, মিশকাত হা/৪৮২৪)। এছাড়া হাদীছে মিথ্যুকের শাস্তি হিসাবে বর্ণিত হয়েছে যে, মিথ্যুকের এক চোয়াল থেকে আরেক চোয়াল পর্যন্ত মাথা বাঁকা লোহার অস্ত্র দিয়ে চিরে ফেলা হবে। অতঃপর তা ভাল হয়ে যাবে। আবার চেরা হবে। এভাবে কিয়ামত পর্যন্ত তার শাস্তি চলতে থাকবে (বুখারী হা/১৩৮৬; মিশকাত হা/৪৬২১)। অতএব মিথ্যা কথা থেকে বেঁচে থাকা আবশ্যক।

--লোক সংগীত কিংবদন্তী বারী সিদ্দিকী --- --------------------------------------------------------------- তার গাওয়া ‘শুয়া চান পাখি, ‘আমার গায়ে যত দুঃখ সয়’, ‘সাড়ে তিন হাত কবর’, ‘তুমি থাকো কারাগারে’, ‘রজনী হইস না অবসর’ ইত্যাদি অসম্ভব জনপ্রিয় গানগুলো আজো বাংলাদেশের গ্রাম ও শহরাঞ্চলের হাজারো মানুষের মুখে মুখে ফেরে। ১৯৫৪ সালের ১৫ নভেম্বর নেত্রকোনা জেলার এক সঙ্গীতজ্ঞ পরিবারে জন্মগ্রহণ করেন। শৈশবে পরিবারের কাছে গান শেখায় হাতেখড়ি হয়। পরিবারের সবাই ছিলেন গানের অনুরাগী। মাত্র ৫ বছর বয়সে তিনি গান গাওয়া শুরু করেন। ১২ বছর বয়সে নেত্রকোনার শিল্পী ওস্তাদ গোপাল দত্তের অধীনে তাঁর আনুষ্ঠানিক প্রশিক্ষণ শুরু হয়। তিনি ওস্তাদ আমিনুর রহমান, দবির খান, পান্নালাল ঘোষ সহ অসংখ্য গুণীশিল্পীর সরাসরি সান্নিধ্য লাভ করেন।  ওস্তাদ আমিনুর রহমান একটি কনসার্টের সময় বারি সিদ্দিকীকে অবলোকন করেন এবং তাঁকে প্রশিক্ষণের প্রস্তাব দেন। পরবর্তী ছয় বছর ধরে তিনি ওস্তাদ আমিনুর রহমানের অধীনে প্রশিক্ষণ নেন। সত্তরের দশকে জেলা শিল্পকলা একাডেমির সাথে যুক্ত হন। ওস্তাদ গোপাল দত্তের পরামর্শে ক্ল্যাসিকাল মিউজিক এরুপর পড়াশোনা শুরু করেন। পরবর্তী সময়ে বাঁশির প্রতি আগ্রহী হয়ে ওঠেন ও বাঁশির ওপর উচ্চাঙ্গসঙ্গীতে প্রশিক্ষণ নেন। নব্বইয়ের দশকে ভারতের পুনে’তে গিয়ে পণ্ডিত ভিজি কার্নাডের কাছে তালিম নেন। দেশে ফিরে এসে লোকগীতির সাথে ক্ল্যাসিকাল মিউজিকের সম্মিলনে গান গাওয়া শুরু করেন।   মূলতঃ বংশী বাদক বারী সিদ্দিকী অল্পদিনেই বিরহ-বিচ্ছেদের মর্মভেদী গনের মধ্য দিয়ে সাধারণ মানুষের হৃদয়ে স্থায়ী আসন করে নেন। তিনি প্রথম জনসম্মুখে সঙ্গীত পরিবেশন করেন ১৯৯৫ সালে, ‘রঙের বাড়ই’ নামের একটা ম্যাগাজিন অনুষ্ঠানে। দীর্ঘদিন সঙ্গীতের সঙ্গে জড়িত থাকলেও সবার কাছে বারী সিদ্দিকী কণ্ঠশিল্পী হিসেবে পরিচিতি পান ১৯৯৯ সালে হ‌ুমায়ূন আহমেদের ‘শ্রাবণ মেঘের দিন’ ছবিটি মুক্তি পাওয়ার পর। এই ছবিতে তার গাওয়া সাতটি গানই ব্যাপক জনপ্রিয়তা পায়। বিশেষ করে তার ‘শুয়া চান পাখি’ গানটির অসামান্য দরদ আর আকুলতা ছুঁয়ে যায় হাজারো শ্রোতার হৃদয়।  ১৯৯৯ খ্রিস্টাব্দে জেনেভায় অনুষ্ঠিত বিশ্ব বাঁশি সম্মেলনে ভারতীয় উপমহাদেশ থেকে একমাত্র প্রতিনিধি হিসেবে অংশ নেন বারী সিদ্দিকী। তাঁর জনপ্রিয় হওয়া গানগুলোর মধ্যে রয়েছে ‘শুয়া চান পাখি আমি ডাকিতাছি তুমি ঘুমাইছ নাকি’, ‘পূবালি বাতাসে’, ‘আমার গায়ে যত দুঃখ সয়’, ‘ওলো ভাবিজান নাউ বাওয়া’, ‘মানুষ ধরো মানুষ ভজো’। এরপর তিনি চলচ্চিত্রে প্লেব্যাক করেছেন। তাঁর গাওয়া গান নিয়ে বেরিয়েছে অডিও অ্যালবাম।  লোকসঙ্গীতের সদ্য সমাপ্ত আয়োজন ফোক ফেস্টেও ৬০-৬৫ হাজার দর্শকের সামনে গান গেয়েছেন বারী সিদ্দিকী। বর্তমানে হৃদরোগে আক্রান্ত হয়ে রাজধানীর স্কয়ার হাসপাতালের নিবিড় পরিচর্যা কেন্দ্রে (আইসিইউ) লাইফ সাপোর্টে আছেন জনপ্রিয় এই সংগীতশিল্পী। আমরা প্রার্থনা করি যেন গানের মানুষ সুরের মানুষকে সুস্থ হয়ে আবার তাঁর গান নিয়ে আমাদের মাঝে ফিরতে পারেন। ---#শ্রাবণী
১৭তম কিউবার রাষ্ট্রপতি এবং কমিউনিস্ট পার্টি কেন্দ্রীয় কমিটির প্রথম সচিব বিপ্লবী নেতা ফিদেল ক্যাস্ত্রো বলেছিলেন,'মৃত্যুর পর কোথাও যেনো তার মূর্তি এবং ছবি টাঙ্গানো যেনো না হয়!' কিউবাবাসী সেই কথা রেখেছিলেন কারণ ফিদেল ক্যাস্ত্রো আরো বলেছিলেন, তার একমাত্র জায়গা মানুষ হৃদয়ে তিনি শুধু সেখানে থাকতে রাজি আর কোথাও না! . ফিদেল কাস্ত্রোর যখন বিচার চলছিলো তখন তিনি একটা কথা বলছিলেন,'আমাকে অপরাধী বানাতে পারো, এটা কোনো গুরুত্ব বহন করে না। ইতিহাস আমাকে মুক্তি দেবে' . সোজা কথা এটা! ইতিহাস নির্ধারণ করে দিবে কে ভালো কাজ করেছে আর কে খারাপ কাজ করেছে! . আমি মূর্তিতে বিশ্বাস করিনা! আবার যারা বিশ্বাস করে তাদের হৃদয়ে আঘাতও করতে চাই না! . শুধু বিশ্বাস করি এই হৃদয়ে আল্লাহ নামে একজন সৃষ্টিকর্তা বসবাস করেন! হৃদয়ের বাহিরে তাকে রাখার জন্য আর কোন জায়গা নেই . ক্যাস্ত্রো বলছিলেন, আমি হিমালয় দেখিনি বঙ্গবন্ধুকে দেখেছি! বঙ্গবন্ধুর দেশে তার কন্যার আমলে আমি এসব অসঙ্গতি মেনে নিতে পারিনা! . আমি বঙ্গবন্ধুকে হৃদয়ে রাখবো না দেয়ালে টাঙ্গিয়ে রাখবো তা কেউ নির্ধারণ করে দিতে পারে না তেমনি হৃদয়ে না রেখে দেয়ালে টাঙ্গালে সেটা কি প্রকৃত শ্রদ্ধা হয়? . আমি আমার বাবা মায়ের ছবি আমার বেডরুমে ঝুলিয়ে রাখিনি বলে কি আমি ওদের ভালবাসি না? . রবীন্দ্রনাথ বলেছিলেন, ভালবাসার জন্য আমাকে একটু অবসর দাও! কঠিন কথা! তেমনি স্বাধীনতা দেওয়া লাগে মন কে! . নোবেল বিজয়ী উইলিবান্ট বলেছিলেন, 'মুজিব হত্যার পর বাঙালীদের আর বিশ্বাস করা যায় না,যারা মুজিবকে হত্যা করেছে তারা যেকোন জঘন্য কাজ করতে পারে!' . সুতরাং ছবি টাঙ্গায়ে তাদের হৃদয় ধোলাই করা যাবে না . এভাবে ধোলাই করতে হয়,'সাত কোটি বাঙ্গালির ভালোবাসার কাঙ্গাল আমি। আমি সব হারাতে পারি, কিন্তু বাংলাদেশের মানুষের ভালোবাসা হারাতে পারব না।' . ভালবাসা হৃদয়ে থাকে মূর্তিতে না.....! তোমরা যদি মূর্তিতে ভালবাসা খুঁজে পাও তাতে বাধা দেওয়ার অধিকার আমার নেই! সবার মতের প্রতি শ্রদ্ধা দেখানো হলো প্রকৃত মানুষ্যত্ব! . লিখেছেন, abdur rob sharif

গল্পঃ ব্যর্থ অভিনেতা লেখা: s m shopnil ahmed. প্রচন্ড গরমে মুখের ভেতরটা তেতো লাগে। কি অসহ্য গরমটাই না পড়েছে। সূর্যটার দিকে একবার বিরক্তচোখে তাকিয়েই আবার চোখ ফিরিয়ে নিতে হল। ভীষন চকচক করছে হলুদ দৈত্যটা। পারলে চোখ পুড়িয়ে ফেলে- অবস্থা। হলুদ আগুনের ঝাপটায় চোখ ধাঁধিয়ে যায়। খুব খারাপ একটা গালি ঠোঁটের আগায় চলে এসেছিল। দিতে গিয়েও সামলে নিলাম। রমজান মাস; গালি দেয়া ঠিক না। রোজা রেখে গালি দিলে রোজা হালকা হয়ে যায়। এই গরমে এত কষ্ট করে হালকা রোজা রাখার কোন মানে হয় না।গায়ের শার্টটা ঘামে ভিজে চটচটে হয়ে আছে। পিঠের কাছটায় শার্টটা শরীরের সাথে লেপ্টে গেছে। বাতাসে বায়বীয় আগুন ছড়ানো। প্রচন্ড রোদে সবার দিশেহারা অবস্থা। চারিদিকের মানুষগুলো খুব দ্রুত চলে। যেন একটু থামলেই গায়ে আগুন লেগে যাবে। রাস্তাজুড়ে গাড়ির লম্বা লাইন। এদিক থেকে ওদিক- যতদূর চোখ যায় শুধু গাড়ি। তারা ট্রেনিংপ্রাপ্ত সৈনিকের মত স্থির দাঁড়িয়ে থাকে। অধিকাংশই প্রাইভেট কার। অল্পকিছু বাসও আছে অবশ্য। এরা কখন গন্তব্যে পৌছাবে কে জানে। অবশ্য তাতে তাদের খুব একটা কষ্ট হওয়ার কথা না। গাড়ির কাচ উঠানো; ভেতরে এসি চলছে। বাইরের তাপ তাদের ত্বক স্পর্শ করতে পারে না। বিশাল সূর্যটাও তাদের কাছে পরাজিত। কিশোর-কিশোরীর দল ফুল আর খবরের কাগজ নিয়ে শুকনো মুখে গাড়ির কাচের কাছে গিয়ে কিছু বলছে। তাদের মিনতি কাচের অন্যপ্রান্তে পৌছায় না, কাচ নামে না, এবং তারা আগের চেয়েশুকনোমুখে অন্য কোন কাচের কাছে গিয়ে মিনতি ঝরায়।এসব দেখতে দেখতে আমার ঘুম আসে। খুব গরমে শরীরটা অবশ যেন। প্রচন্ড ঘুমে চোখের পাতা ভারী হয়ে আসতে চায়। ইচ্ছে করে প্রচন্ড গরমে এই ঘামেভেজা শার্টটা গায়ে জড়িয়েই ঘুমিয়ে যেতে।চোখটা ভারী ভারী লাগে। ভয়ংকর রোদের কারনে হয়ত। আর মাথার দু'দিকের শিরা দপদপ করে। যেকোনমূহুর্তে ফেটে যাবে যেন।রাস্তার সিগনাল ছেড়ে দেয়। সবুজ বাতিটা একটা ব্যাঙ্গের হাসি হেসে জ্বলে ওঠে। আর সাথে সাথেই রাস্তার চিত্রটা চট করে বদলে যায়। একটু আগের শান্ত রাস্তাটা যেন একটা উদ্দাম যুদ্ধক্ষেত্রে পরিনত হয়। আর ড্রাইভাররা তাদের শব্দশক্তির প্রদর্শনীতে ব্যস্ত হয়ে যায়। কে কার চেয়ে বেশি জোরে আর বেশি সময় ধরে হর্ণ বাজাবে তাই নিয়ে প্রতিযোগীতা শুরু হয়। হর্ণের প্রচন্ড শব্দে দিশেহারা অবস্থা। ভীষন রাগে আমার ভেতরের বিপ্লবী স্বত্ত্বাটা কাঁপতে থাকে। আমার খুব ভীষন ইচ্ছে করে রাস্তার ড্রাইভারগুলোকে লাইন ধরে দাঁড় করিয়ে ঠাস ঠাস শব্দে চড় লাগাতে। সাথে এই সবকয়টাবড়লোকের বাচ্চাগুলোকে। মনে মনে একটা গালি দিয়ে ফেলি ভুলে। প্রায় সাথে সাথেই আল্লাহর কাছে ক্ষমা চেয়ে নিই। তিনি অসীম দয়ালু। তার দয়ার কোন সীমা-পরিসীমা নেই।অল্পক্ষনেই রাস্তাটা আবার জমে যায়। সিগনাল পড়েছে। পরাজিত ড্রাইভাররা শান্তমুখে গালাগালি করছে। স্থির রাস্তার পাশে আমি হাঁটতে থাকি। চোখে-মুখে একটা তাচ্ছিল্যের চমক নিয়ে আমি হেঁটে যাই। পাশে পড়ে থাকে যন্ত্রদানবগুলো। কিছুক্ষন আগের সেই ভীষন তেজ হারিয়ে অসহায়। পরাজিত ড্রাইভারগুলোর জন্য আমারএকটু মায়া মায়া লাগে। আহা বেচারারা। প্রচন্ড রোদে কুল কুল ঘামতে ঘামতে আমি পা চালাই।গরম-ক্ষুদা-তৃষ্ণা। ক্লান্তিতে শরীর অবশ হয়ে আসতে চায়।'এইত আর অল্প একটু পথ।' মনে মনে নিজেকে স্বান্তনা দিই।এই আগুনে ফার্মগেট থেকে আজিমপুর হেঁটে যেতে যথেষ্ঠ সাহস প্রয়োজন। মাইল তিনেক রাস্তাও এই সূর্য মাথায় নিয়ে তিরিশ মাইল হয়ে যায়। তবে ইচ্ছা করলেই অবশ্য একটা রিকশা ডেকে চেপে বসা যেত। ইচ্ছে করলে হুডটাও তুলে দেওয়া যেত। আর হাতদু'টো কোলে নিয়ে বসে থাকা। একেবারে নিশ্চিন্ত অবস্থা। পকেটের দিকেতাকিয়ে সাহস পাচ্ছিলাম না। মাসের শেষ দিকে একজন মধ্যমশ্রেনীর মধ্যবিত্তের রিকশাওয়ালাকে ডাকতে যথেষ্ঠ সাহসের প্রয়োজন। আর হাঁটলে নাকি শরীর ভালো থাকে। রক্তের সুগার কমে। বয়স হয়ে যাচ্ছে, এই সময় রক্তের সুগার কম থাকা দরকার।'ঐ মিয়া। চাইপা হাঁটেন। রিকশার নিচে পড়বেনতো মিয়া।'বুড়ো রিকশাওয়ালার কথায় চমকে উঠে সরে গেলাম একটু। রিকশাটা পা ঘেঁষে সাঁই সাঁই করে বেরিয়ে যায়। শরীরটা পুরোপুরি টেনে নেয়ার আগে সামান্য ঘষাও লাগে। তাতে রিকশার কিছুই যায়-আসে না।রিকশাওয়ালাদের মাথাব্যথা থাকে অন্য কোন গাড়ীর বা রিকশার গা ঘেষে চলার সময়। তাদের দেখে মনে হয় পরীক্ষার খাতায় কম্পাস দিয়ে অতিযত্নে সম্পাদ্য আঁকা কোন ছাত্র বোধহয়। সেটাই তাদের কাছে বড় ব্যাপার। আমার মত মানুষের ব্যাপারে তাদের কোন মাথাব্যথা নেই। বুড়ো রিকশাওয়ালা এবং তার ছোকরাটাইপের প্যাসেঞ্জার আমার দিকে বিরস দৃষ্টি মেখে যায়। প্যাডেলে দ্রুত পা ঘুরাতে ঘুরাতে হয়ত আরো কিছু বলে সে। পরিষ্কার শোনা যায় না ঠিক। এরকম আনমনা হয়ে রাস্তায় হাঁটা কোন কাজের কথা না। নিজের উপর বিরক্তি লাগে খুব।শরীফ ভাইয়ের কথা ভাবছিলাম। আমার সাথেই চাকরি করত। নিরীহ- ভালোমানুষটাইপের মানুষ। মাসদুয়েক আগে হুট করে চাকরিটা চলে গেল। দুই মেয়ে আর একমাত্র ছেলেটাকে নিয়ে ভীষন বিপদে পড়ে যায় বেচারা। প্রায় না খেয়ে থাকার যোগাড়। খুব দুরবস্থা হয়েছিল তখন। সেসময় শরীফ ভাই কিছু টাকা ধার নিয়েছিলেন। এর জন্যই শরীফভাইয়ের বাসায় গিয়েছিলাম। যদি টাকাটা পাওয়া যায়। টাকাকটার বেশ দরকার। রমজান মাস শেষের দিকে। ঈদে আমার একটা ছোট নীল জামা কেনা খুব জরুরী। ছোট- সুন্দর নীল একটা ফ্রক। বুকের কাছটায় পুতির কাজ করা। আলো পড়লে চিকচিক করে ওঠে।সামান্য একটা কেরানীর চাকরীতে কয় পয়সাই বা পাওয়া যায়। এই আগুনের বাজারে তা দিয়ে বেঁচে থাকা যায়, ভদ্রভাবে বাঁচা যায়না। যেদিকে তাকানো যায়- শুধু খরচ আর খরচ। মাঝে মাঝে ইচ্ছা হয় অন্ধ হয়ে যাই। খুব কষ্ট হয় কখনো কখনো। মাঝরাত্তিতে ঘুম ভাঙ্গলে মাঝে মাঝে মরে যেতে ইচ্ছে করে।টাকাটা পাওয়া যায় নি। শরীফ ভাইয়ের স্ত্রী অসুস্থ। হাসপাতালেআছেন। লিভারের দোষ। অপারেশনও করাতে হবে বোধহয়। অনেক টাকার ব্যাপার। সেখানে আমার টাকা কয়টার কথা বলতে বাধছিল। শরীফ ভাই নিজ থেকেই বললেন টাকার কথা।'সামনের মাসেই তোমার টাকাটা দিয়ে দিব হাবীব। দেশের বাড়ির জমিটুকু বিক্রির চেষ্টা করছি।'শুনে আমার মন খারাপ হয়। শরীফ ভাইয়ের চোখদু'টির দিকে তাকানো যায় না। কালিপড়া চোখে কি ভয়ংকর মৃতদৃষ্টি। কোন জীবিত মানুষের চোখের দৃষ্টি কি এমন হয়? চোখজুড়ে শুকনো অশ্রু লেপ্টে আছে। ঘরটাও কেমন জানি হাহাকার করছে। ছোট-ছোট ছেলেমেয়ের মুখগুলো অসম্ভব করুন। আমি মাথা নিচু করে বের হয়ে আসি। মাঝে মাঝে স্রষ্টা এমন অন্যায় করে কিভাবে কে জানে। অবিচারের ভেতর অবিচার।পা টা জ্বলছে। আমি থামলাম। রিকশাটার সাথে লেগে পায়ের বেশ খানিকটা ছড়ে গেছে। একটা ফার্মেসী থেকে তুলা নিয়ে ছড়ে যাওয়া জায়গাটুকুতে চেপে ধরি। তুলার গায়ে লাল লাল ছোপ ছোপ দাগ পড়ে যায়। শরীরটা ক্লান্ত লাগে। বুড়ো হয়ে যাচ্ছি। ভাবতেই মনের ভেতর একটা দুঃখ-হাসি উঁকি দেয়। জীবন খুব অদ্ভুত জিনিস। বাঁচতেও কষ্ট, মরতেও আক্ষেপ। অলস দুপুরের চারিদিকে এক ঘোর লাগা বিভ্রম যেন। সবকিছু যেন ক্লান্ত- থেমে আছে। ক্লান্তির হাত থেকে রেহাই পায় নি বেশরম সূর্যটাও। আরেকটু জিরিয়ে নেব কিনা ভাবতে ভাবতেই উঠে পড়লাম। গোড়ালীর দিকটা ব্যথা করছে অল্প অল্প। পাত্তা দিলাম না। আরেকটু এগুলেই বাসায় পৌঁছে যাব।আমার মনে একজোড়া শুকনো হাতের ছবি মনে ভেসে ওঠে। আর দু'টো মায়াঘেরা চোখ। আমার অভিনয়সঙ্গী। বেঁচে থাকার জন্য একটা ছোটচাকরি করলেও আমি মূলত একজন অভিনেতা। আমাকে অভিনয় করে করে বাঁচতে হয়। আর আমার মায়া মায়া বৌটাও আমার সাথে পাল্লা দিয়েঅভিনয় করে যায় সারাবেলা। আমরা নিজেদেরকে বোঝাই- এইতো আমরা বেশ আছি, আমরা বেঁচে আছি।'তুমি ঈদে একটা শার্ট নাও না। এই শার্টটা অনেক পুরনো হয়ে গেছে।''আরো ক'টা দিন যাক নাহয়। বেশতো চলছে।'নীরবতা। খোদা যেন দু'টি মানুষের কথা বলার ক্ষমতা হঠাৎ করে কেঁড়ে নেয়। আমার বুকটা টিপটিপ করে। শার্টের গলার কাছটায় ছোট একটাফুটোমত আছে। শাহানা সেটার কথা বলে যদি? খুব লজ্জা পেয়ে যাব।'আচ্ছা তোমাকে একটা শাড়ি কিনে দেই? একটা শাড়ী নাও।''থাক। শুধুশুধুই টাকা নষ্ট করতে হবে না। গতবারের শাড়ীটতো প্রায় নতুনই আছে। দরকার হলে পরে কিনে নেওয়া যাবে।' বৌটা হাসে। ফ্যাকাসেহাসিটুকু ওই নরম গালে ঠিকভাবে ফোটে না।***সিঁড়ির গোঁড়ায় মনসুর সাহেবের সাথে দেখা হল। মাথায় বিশাল টাকপড়া এই লোকটাই আমাদের বাড়ীওয়ালা। তাকে দেখেই আমার মুখটা হাসিহাসি হয়ে গেল। মধ্যবিত্তের কাছে বাড়ীওয়ালা হল দ্বিতীয় ঈশ্বর। সেই হিসেবে আমার দ্বিতীয় ঈশ্বরটা খুব একটা সুবিধার না। দু'একদিন ভাড়া দিতে দেরী হলেই দুনিয়া মাথায় তুলে ফেলেন। আমি মুখে একটা তেলতেলে হাসি ঝুলিয়ে গলাটা যথাসম্ভব কোমল করে সালাম দিলাম।'আফজাল সাহেব, এইবার কিন্তু ভাড়া নিয়ে কোন উল্টাপাল্টা করা চলবে না। ঈদের বাজার।'আমি একজন দক্ষ অভিনয়শিল্পীর মত মুখটাতে আরেকটু তেলতেলে ভাব আনতে চাইলাম। আর মনসুর সাহেব তার প্যাঁচার মত মুখটায় আরেকপোচ বিরক্তি মেখে নিচে নেমে যান। 'ব্যাটা চামার।' আমি মুখথেকে তেলতেলে ভাবটা ঝেড়ে ফেলে উপরে উঠতে থাকি।দরজা খুলতেই আমার বুকে ঝাঁপিয়ে পড়ল আমার ছোট বাবুই পাখিটা। আমার এতক্ষনের তপ্ত বুকটা শান্ত হয়ে যায়। এইমূহুর্তটাতে নিজেকে একজন সুখী মানুষ ভাবতে খুব ইচ্ছে করে আমার। একজন সত্যিকারের সুখী মানুষ। লাল টুকটুকে ফ্রক পড়া ছোট বুড়িটা আমার কোলে উঠেআসে।'এতদেরী করলে কেন বাবা?' আধো আধো কথাগুলো শুনতে আমার ভীষন মায়া লাগে।'রাস্তায় অনেক জ্যাম যে বাবা। তাই দেরী হয়ে গেল।' আমি অহনাকে নিয়ে বসতে বসতে জবাব দেই।'মা বলেছে তুমি নাকি আমার জন্য ঈদের ড্রেস কিনতে ঘুরছ।' অহনা থামে। 'আমারতো জামা আছেই। মা বলেছে আমার হলুদ জামাটা ধুয়ে দিবে। তারপর সেটাও নতুন জামা হয়ে যাবে। তাই না বাবা?'আমি জবাব দিলাম না। বুকের ভেতরটা চিন চিন করে ওঠে। বুকের ভেতর নাম না জানা একটা সুর বেজে যায়, একঘেয়ে। সেই সুরটা বুক বেয়ে চোখের কাছটায় এসে আলতো করে টোকা দেয়।'বাবা তোমার চোখে পানি কেন? তোমার চোখে কি পোকা পড়েছে বাবা?''নিজেকে আমি বেশ ভালো অভিনেতা ভাবতাম। জীবনের প্রতিটি বাঁকে আমাকে অভিনয় করতে হয়। সুখী থাকার অভিনয়, বেঁচে থাকার অভিনয়।বৌটার সাথে অভিনয়, অফিসের বসের সাথে অভিনয়, বাড়ীওয়ালার সাথে অভিনয়, বাসের কন্ডাক্টর বা বাজারের তরকারিওয়ালাটার সাথে অভিনয়।শুধু মেয়েটার সামনে আমি ঠিকঠাক অভিনয় করতে পারি না। আমি ধরা পড়ে যাই।আমি লোকটা একজন ব্যার্থ মানুষ। একজন ব্যর্থ স্বামী, ব্যর্থ বাবা। তবু এই সময়টাতে আমার একজন ভালো অভিনেতা না হওয়ার ব্যর্থতাটাবাকীসব ব্যর্থতাকে ছাপিয়ে যায়। আমার বুড়ো বুকটা হু হু করে ওঠে। বেঁচে থাকায় এত কষ্ট কেন?ছোট একটা পুতুলকে বুকে জড়িয়ে রাখে একজন ব্যর্থ অভিনেতা collected

"তুমি ঠিকই বলেছো আমি একটা স্টুপিড। কারন এতোটা স্টুপিড না হলে তোমাকে এখনো কি ঠিক ততোটাই ভালবাসি যতটুকু আগেও বেশেছি। তুমি আমার সাথে অভিনয় করলে আর আমিও তোমাকে আগের মত ভালবাসি"। কথাগুলো বলতে বলতে চোখ দিয়ে অশ্রু ঝড়ছিলো আলভি'র। ছেলেদের চোখে অশ্রু নাকি শোভা পায়না। কিন্তু দুঃখের বহিঃপ্রকাশ আর কিভাবেই বা করবে সে? একবার স্মোকিং করেছিলো স্পর্শিয়া'র সাথে দেখা করার পূর্বে। তবে ঠিকই বুঝে ফেলেছিল স্পর্শিয়া। তাই আর এমন টা করেনা সে। . ~~যখন জানতে পারলো স্পর্শিয়া শুধু তার সাথেই নয় আরও কিছু ছেলের সাথে সম্পর্ক রয়েছে। তখন একটিবারও অবিশ্বাস করতে চায়নি। কিন্তু স্পর্শিয়া কে জিগ্গাসা করতেই সে বলল, "হ্যা আমি অনেকগুলো রিলেশান রাখি, আমার ভাল লাগে তাই এমনটা করি। তোমার ইচ্ছে হলে এখন তুমি চাইলে আমার সাথে ব্রেকাপ করো তাতে আমার কিছু আসে যাবেনা। অথচ তুমি এতোটাই বোকা যে এখনো বলতেছে জাস্ট তোমাকে যেন ভালবাসি?" , , ~~আলভি নিজের চোখ দুটো মুছে স্পর্শিয়া'র দিকে তাকিয়ে বলল, "জীবনে প্রথম বার তুমি আমাকে জান বলে ডেকেছিলে তখন মনে হয়েছিলো, এই মানুষটা আমার বড়ই আপন। তোমার মুখে জান শব্দ টা শুনে আমার কাছে শুধুই আপন মনে হতো না, মনে হতো তোমার জীবনটাই যেন আমি নয়ত আমাকে কেনো জান বলে ডাকবে। এতোটাই তো ভালবাসি তোমায়। আজ তাহলে সে জান শব্দ টার মানে কি হলো একটু বলবে?" , ~~"দেখো আলভি রিলেশানে জড়ালে জান, বাবু, সোনা, লক্ষীটি, কলিজা ইত্যাদি এমনি বলে গফ/বফ কে। তার মানে এটা না যে এগুলো সব সময় মনে রাখতে হবে, আর এর একটা মানে থাকবে"। , ~~"তুমি বোধ হয় আমাকে আর কখনো জান বলে ডাকবে না, আমি যখন শুনলাম তোমার একাধিক রিলেশান রয়েছে তখন যতোটা না খারাপ লেগেছে তার থেকে বেশি খারাপ লাগছে এটা শুনে যে, তোমার সাথে ব্রেকাপ করলে তোমার কিছু হবেনা। তুমি কি একটিবারও আমাকে মনে করবে না? তোমার সাথে কাটানো আমার কিছু আনন্দদায়ক রোমান্টিক মুহুর্ত গুলো, এগুলোর কি তোমার কাছে কোনো মানে নেই?" , ~~"আমার কাছে এসবের কোনো মানে নেই, আমি শুধু তোমার সাথেই টাইম পাস করিনি আরও অনেকের সাথে করেছি, করি। তাই এসব আমার কাছে কোনো ব্যাপার না। আর আমি তোমার সাথে এসব নিয়ে কথা বলতে চাইছিনা আমার ভাল লাগছেনা। তুমি বরং এমন একজন কে খুজে নাও যে একমাত্রই তোমাকে লাভ করবে, তোমাকে জান বলবে। ভাল থেকো আলভি"। , , ~~স্পর্শিয়া চলে যাবার পর আলভি ফোনটা বের করে, তাকে ফোন করলে সে বার বার কেটে দিতে থাকে। রোডের পাশ দিয়ে হাটতে গিয়ে অনেকের সাথে ধাক্কা লেগে কত কথাই শুনতে হয় তাকে। পাগল, অন্ধ ইত্যাদি। , ~~আলভি বরাবরই অনেকটা ইমোশোনাল টাইপের ছেলে। যে ছেলে একমাত্র স্পর্শিয়া কে ছাড়া আর কারো কথা ভাবতোও না। স্পর্শিয়া খুব সুন্দরী একটি মেয়ে তাও নয়। কিন্তু আলভি'র কাছে তার ভালবাসার মূল্য অনেক। , , "if u leave me, i promise u will come back once with ur open eyes to see my close eys". ~~আলভি মেসেজটি পাঠানোর কিছু সময় পরই স্পর্শিয়া একটি স্মাইল ইমো রিপ্লাই করে। চোখ দুটি ভিজে ওঠে আবার আলভি'র। , ~~"ফিরে এসো স্পর্শিয়া, আজ সারা দিন একটিবারও আমাকে তুমি জান বলে ডাকলে না। হৃদয় টা ব্যাথায় ছিড়েঁ যেতে চাইছে। জানি তুমি আমাকে আর ভালবাসি বলবেনা, আমি তো সেটা শুনতে জোর করছিনা একটিবার জান বলে ডাকবেনা আমায়?" মেসেজটি ঘুমানোর পূর্বে সেন্ড করে ফোনের স্ক্রীনের দিকে বার বার তাকাচ্ছে। , ~~কোনো রিপ্লাই না আসায় স্পর্শিয়া কে কল করে, কয়েকবার রিসিভ না করলেও পরে রিসিভ করলো। "বলো কি বলবে? তাড়া তাড়ি বলো? "জান বলে একটিবার ডাকবে প্লিজ? "এসব ন্যাকামো আমার একটুও ভাল লাগছেনা। "একবার শুধু বলো নয়ত আমি পাগল হয়ে যাবো। "যাও পাগল হয়ে, বা তুমি মরেই যাও তাতে আমার কিছুনা। , , ~~স্পর্শিয়া'র শেষ কথাটি কানে বাজতে থাকে। সারা রাত ঘুমাতে পারলো না। সারা রাত না ঘুমানোর ফলে চোখ দুটি লাল হয়ে রয়েছে। ঘুমে'র ঝিম এলেও ঘুমাতে চায়না আলভি। এই ঘুমই বা এমন কি ঘুম? জেগে উঠলেই তো স্পর্শিয়া কে মনে পড়বে। সুইসাইড করার মত সাহস তার মধ্যে নেই। কি করবে সে? , ~"রাফি আমাকে একটা হেল্প করবি? ~"তোর কন্ঠটা এমন শোনাচ্ছে কেনো? ~"সুইসাইড করতে চাই, একটা ইজি ওয়ে বল। ~"ওহ তাহলে তো আগে দেখা কর কারন বলছি সব থেকে ইজি ওয়ে। ~"এক্ষুনি আসছি। , , ~~সম্পূর্ন ঘটনা খুলে বলে রাফি কে। "হুম বুঝলাম। কিন্তু ওর মত একটা মেয়ের জন্য তুই কেনো সুইসাইড করবি? তুই তো সত্যি ভালবাসতিস তাইনা?"। বিষন্ন হয়েই আলভি বলল, "হ্যা, সত্যি অনেক ভালবাসি ওকে"। "তাহলে এক কাজ কর নিজে সুইসাইড করার আগে ওকে মেরে ফেল"। , ~"আমি এটা কিভাবে করবো?" ~"কেনো করবিনা? ~"আমি ওকে ভালবাসি। ওকে একদিন হলেও জান বলেছিলাম। ~"ঠিক আছে তাহলে তুই নিজেই সুইসাইড কর ~"দোস্ত ও আমাকে অনেক বার জান বলেছে। আমার কিছু হলে সেই জান কথাটার কি কোনো মানে থাকবে? ~"সেটাইতো, তোর কিছু হলে এখন ওর খারাপ লাগবেনা। পরে যদি লাগে, তখন কি কথাটির কোনো মানে থাকবে? ~"দাড়া ওকে একবার কল করি। , , ~"হ্যালো স্পর্শিয়া?"। ~"আবার ফোন দিছো কেনো?" ~"জান বলবে একবার "। ~"কি শুরু করলে?"। ~"তোমাকে জান বলতে বললাম, জানো আমি ভাবলাম যে সুইসাইড করি পরে মনে পড়লো আমার কিছু হলে তোমার বলা জান শব্দটি অর্থহীন হয়ে যাবে। তাই তুমি যত যাই করোনা কেনো? জীবনে কখনো যদি এমন হয় আমার কাছে ফিরে আসতে ইচ্ছে হচ্ছে, মনের মাঝে কোনো সংকোচ রেখো না প্লিজ ফিরে এসো তখন। আমি তোমার জন্য অপেক্ষা করবো জান"। ~"তুমি প্লিজ আমাকে আর বিরক্ত করোনা আলভি"। ~"তা কিভাবে হয় জান, আমি চেয়েছিলাম তো সুইসাইড করবো তোমাকে আর বিরক্ত করবোনা, পরে ভাবলাম আমি মরে গেলে তোমাকে জ্বালাবে কে?"। "উফ অসহ্য"। বলেই ফোনটা কেটে দিলো। , ~~ফোনটা কেটে একটা দীর্ঘশ্বাস ছেড়ে বন্ধুর দিকে তাকালো আলভি। স্পর্শিয়া'র কথা সব শুনতে পেয়েছিল রাফি। সে ভয় করছে যে আলভি আবার না ডিসাইড করে সুইসাইডের জন্য। কিন্তু আলভি হেসেই বলল, "প্রথম ভাবলাম সুইসাইড করি, ও সব সময় ইগনোর করতেছে আমাকে। কষ্ট হয়না বল? বুকটা তো ফেেট যাচ্ছে"। , ~~"এসব বলিস না, ও আর তোকে ইগনোর করবেনা আবার আগের মত ভালবাসবে দেখিস"। , ~"আমি জানি ও আবার ফিরে আসবে।কিন্তু এই অাস্থাটুকুর জন্য সবাই আমাকে হয়ত বোকা বলবে, কিন্তু আমি সত্যিই একটা স্টুপিড তাই আমি নিজের কোনো ক্ষতি করবো না। কারন আমি জানি ও আসবে, হয়ত আমার চোখ দুটি বুজে ফেলার পর"। বলেই বন্ধুকে জড়িয়ে কাদতে থাকে সে। রাফির চোখেও জ্বল এসে যায় বন্ধুর কান্না দেখে। সে জানতো না ভালবাসায় এত কষ্ট, রোমান্টিক ভালবাসা তো কতই দেখেছে। কিন্তু সে জানতো না, প্রিয় মানুষটা হারিয়ে গেলে এভাবে কেউ কাদতে পারে। তাও শুধু তাকে মেয়েটি জান বলে ডেকেছিলো বলে। রিলেশানে, সিম্পল জান বলে তো অনেকেই অনেক কে ডাকে। তবুও এই কথাটা যে শুধু একটি সিম্পল ওয়ার্ড নয় সেটা আজ তার বন্ধু আলভি কে দেখে বুঝলো সে। যে ছেলেটা বোকার মতই কেদে যাচ্ছে, সে যে বুকের মাঝে এতোটা ভালবাসা একটি মেয়ের জন্য বেধে রাখে সেটা যদি স্পর্শিয়া বুঝতো তাহলে বোকা নামক অর্থটি সে তার নিজের জন্যই ব্যবহার করতো। কারন স্পর্শিয়া যাকে বোকা ভাবে, সেই মানুষটা পৃথিবীর সব কিছু উপেক্ষা করেই তাকে ভালবাসে নয়ত সুইসাইড করার মত একটা সিদ্ধান্ত সে প্রথমে নিতো না আর পরে ভাবতোও না সেই মেয়েটি আবার ফিরে আসবে তার কাছে। এতটাই বিশ্বাস করে তাকে। কিন্তু বোকা মেয়েটি বুঝলো না। সে ছেলেটিকে বোকা ভেবে গেলো। তবে বোকা ছেলেটা যে তাকে এতোটা ভালবাসে সেটা চোখে পড়লো না। সত্যি খুব দুর্ভাগ্য স্পর্শিয়া'র। . . লেখা> আলভি আহম্মেদ শাওন (স্টুপিড লাভার)

মেয়েদের শরীরে স্বাভাবিক যৌবিক চাহিদা কতটুকু আমার ঠিক জানা নেই তবে ইদানিং কালের উগ্র সংস্কৃতি মেয়েদের বিপদগামী করছে । তাদের যৌবিক চাহিদা গুলোকে উজ্জিবিত করছে । আগে যেখানে মেয়েরা ছেলেদের সাথে কথা বলতে লজ্জা বোধ করতো সেখানে এখন তারা স্বেচ্ছায় বিছানায় যাচ্ছে । খুব বেশি মনের আদান প্রদান হওয়ার দরকার নেই । মোটামুটি পরিচয় হলেই হলো তারা তাদের দেহ বিলিয়ে দিচ্ছে ।  . ছেলেরা যে সাধু তা কিন্তু না তারা খুব সহজেই একটি মেয়েকে বাহু ডোরে আবদ্ধ করতে পারছে এর কারণ হলো চারিদিকে যৌনতার ছড়াছড়ি । যেখানে তাকাবেন সেখানেই যৌনতা । টিভি, ইন্টারনেট, সোস্যাল মিডিয়া সবখানেই যৌনতার মহা উৎসব চলছে । যখন একটি মেয়ে বা ছেলে এই সব অবলোকন করছে তখনই সে শারীরিক চাহিদা মেটানোর জন্য এক অপরের সম্মুখীন হচ্ছে ।  . গত বিশ বছর আগে আমি এমনটা দেখেনি, অন্তত তখন মেয়েরা অনেকটা শালীন ছিল । এমন উগ্র পোশাক বা এমন উগ্র জীবন যাপনে অভ্যস্ত ছিল না । তাদের মাঝে শালীনতা বোধটা অন্তত জাগ্রত ছিল কিন্তু আজ গোপনে প্রকাশ্যে চলছে শালীনতার অপব্যবহার । চলছে নিজেকে বিলিয়ে দেওয়ার প্রতিযোগিতা । যার ফলশ্রুতিতে সংসার পরবর্তী জীবনে নেমে আসছে অমাবর্ষার কালো ছায়া ।  . ছেলে এবং মেয়েদের যৌবিক চাহিদা সৃষ্টিগত সেটা অবশ্যই প্রয়োগ হবে বিবাহিত জীবনের ভালোবাসা প্রতিদান স্বরূপ কিন্তু সেটা যদি বিয়ের আগেই নষ্ট সামাজিকতায় প্রয়োগ হয়ে যায় তবে সমাজ ব্যবস্থায় নেমে আসবে কালো অধ্যায় । ভেঙে যাবে সমাজের অবকাঠামো ভেঙে যাবে পারিবারিক সুখ স্বাচ্ছন্দ ।  . ছেলে এবং মেয়েদের যৌবিক চাহিদা নিয়ন্ত্রণের একটাই উপায় সেটা হলো ধর্মীয় অনুশাসন মেনে চলা এবং সময় মতো ছেলে এবং মেয়েদের বিয়ে দেওয়া কিন্তু সেটা আর হয়ে উঠছে না তবে অভিভাবকদের এখন তাদের সন্তানদের নিয়ে ভাবনার সময় হয়েছে । যদি তাদের সন্তানদের ধর্মীয় অনুশাসনে অভ্যস্ত না করে এবং সময় মতো তাদের বিয়ে না দেয় তবে ছেলে এবং মেয়েরা বিপদ গামী হবে । বিশেষ করে মেয়েরা উচ্ছন্নে যাবে সবচেয়ে বেশি কারণ মেয়েরা চিকন চালাক হলেও অবেগ বা উগ্র শারীরিক চাহিদায় তারা কাপড় খুলে বোকামী করে বসে এবং প্রতারণার শিকার হয় । . azad abul kalam

" কখনোই না। তবে খুব বেশি ডিপ্রেশনে থাকলে এটা মনে না থাকাই স্বাভাবিক। তারা সবসময় যেভাবেই হোক মুক্তি পেতে চায়! যার জন্য মৃত্যুর পথ নিতে বাধ্য হয়। , চিকিৎসা বিজ্ঞানের মতে, আত্মহত্যার প্রবণতা বা চেষ্টা একটি psychiatric emergency । যারা আত্মহত্যার কথা বলে তাদের একটি বড় অংশ পরে কোন না কোন কারনে ঠিকই আত্মহত্যার প্রচেষ্টায় লিপ্ত হয়। এই সুপ্ত মনের ইচ্ছাকে ও কার্যকর প্রচেষ্টাকে মোটেও সহজ ভাবে নেওয়া যাবে না। , আত্মহত্যার পিছে লুকিয়ে থাকা ৯৫% শতাংশ কারণ হয়ে থাকে মানসিক ও বাকী ৫% শতাংশ কারণ থাকে শারীরিক কোন আঘাত বা ভিন্ন কোন ঘটনা। এছাড়াও যারা দীর্ঘদিন যাবত কষ্ট ও রোগে শোকে ভুগছেন তারা জীবন থেকে মুক্তি পাবার আশায় আত্মহত্যার মত ভুল সিদ্ধান্ত নিয়ে ফেলেন। , আত্মহত্যা রোধ করতে যা করতে হবে, কেউ যদি নিজের জীবন হারাতেই চায়, তবে তাকে বাঁধা দেওয়া বা আটকে রাখা আসলে কারো পক্ষেই সম্ভব নয়। আপনি চাইলেও কারো উপর সর্বক্ষণ নজর রাখতে পারবেন না । তবে আগে থেকেই যদি আত্মহত্যা করার মানসিকতা সনাক্ত করা সম্ভব তবে কাউন্সিলিং এরম মাধ্যমে সেখান থেকে কাউকে জীবনের পথেও ফিরিয়ে আনা সম্ভব। , আত্মহত্যা কেউ স্বেচ্ছায় করে না!! ভাবছেন, "সজীব ভাই উল্টোপাল্টা বুঝাচ্ছেন"! আমি যা বলছি আমার কাছে সঠিক, আপনার কাছে নাও হতে পারে। , স্বেচ্ছায় করেনা "ডিপ্রেশন" আর পরিবেশ করতে বাধ্য করে। , উল্লেখিত চারটি ঘটনা ভালো করে লক্ষ করুন। "অর্ঘ্য বিশ্বাস মেরুদন্ডহীন শিক্ষা পদ্ধতির কারণে ডিপ্রেশনে ছিলেন।" "ফাতেমা আক্তার বিয়ে হয়না বলে সবার কটাক্ষ আর বাবার অত্যাচারে ডিপ্রেশনে ছিলেন।" "আনিসুল রহমান প্রেমে ব্যর্থতা আর ধোকা খাওয়ার জন্য ডিপ্রেশনে ছিলেন।" "মোঃ করিম পারিবারিক আর্থিক সমস্যার কারণে ডিপ্রেশনে ছিলেন।" , তাই তাদের সবার আত্মহত্যার কারণ একই। "ডিপ্রেশন" কাটিয়ে উঠা সহজ না। আপনি চাইলেও সহজে কাটিয়ে উঠতে পারবেন না। এর জন্য প্রয়োজন কাটিয়ে উঠার মতো পরিবেশ। , আমি নিজেও পারছি না! তবে চেষ্টায় আছি। অবশ্যই পারবো ডিপ্রেশন দূর করতে। সাধারণত তিনটি কারণে ডিপ্রেশন এ পড়ে মানুষ আত্মহত্যা করে!!! ১. ফেমিলির আর্থিক বা অন্য কোনো সমস্যা ২.লেখাপড়ার খুব বেশি চাপ ৩. প্রেমে ব্যর্থতা তন্মধ্যে দুটি কারণে খুব বেশি ডিপ্রেশনে আছি!!! তাইলে আমার জন্যও কি অপেক্ষা করছে..?? , যে কাজে বেশী মানষিক চাপ মনে করেন সেটা এড়িয়ে চলার মাধ্যমে ডিপ্রেশন দূর করা যায়। এভাবেই চেষ্টায় আছি!! . লেখা : সজীব সূত্রধর ( মৃতকল্প)

আমি তোমাকে ভালোবাসি,এই কথাটি বলার পরে অপরজনের উত্তর যদি একই হয়,তাহলে শুরু হয়ে যায় একটি নতুন সম্পর্ক।এই নতুন সম্পর্কটি আবেগের কারনে তৈরি হয়।আবেগ ছাড়া কখনো ভালোবাসা হয় না,কোন সম্পর্ক তৈরি হয় না।.আবার আবেগ ছাড়া কখনো কষ্ট পাওয়া যায় না। যার আবেগ যত বেশি সে তত বেশি ভালোবাসতে পারে,প্রিয় মানুষকে নিয়ে কল্পনা বেশি বেশি করতে পারে।আবার বেশি বেশি কষ্টও পাই।নির্ঘুম রাত কাটাতে থাকে।তাহলে বেশি আবেগের দরকারটা কি।আবেগকে কখনো প্রশ্রয় দেওয়া উচিত না ।.যখন নতুন সম্পর্ক শুরু হয় তখন দিনগুলো নিজের কাছে স্বপ্নের মতন লাগে।মনে সবসময় আনন্দ ও সুখ থেকে থাকে।কিন্তু তখন নিজেকে জানা উচিত এই সম্পর্ক টিকে না থাকতেও পারে।সেইজন্য সম্পর্কের আগে নিজেকে এমন ভাবে তৈরি করে নিতে হবে জেনো সম্পর্কটি শেষ হলেও নিজেকে ঠিক রাখতে পারেন।নাহলে নিজেকে অন্ধকারে ফেলে রাখতে হবে, অন্যের জন্য চোখের জ্বল ফেলে নিজের জীবন নষ্ট করে ফেলতে হবে।.একটি প্রেম জীবনকে কখনো সম্পূর্ন ভাবে প্রতিষ্ঠিত করতে পারেনা।কিন্তু প্রতিষ্ঠিত জীবনকে শেষ করে দিতে পারে ।প্রেমে যেমন সুখ রয়েছে তেমনি কষ্টও রয়েছে।তবে কষ্টের পরিমানটা বেশি।একটি মেয়ের জন্য একটি ছেলে কেনো তার জীবন নষ্ট করবে।কেনো নির্ঘুম রাত কাটাবে,অন্ধকারে কেনো চোখের জ্বল ফেলবে।.প্রেম করার আগে একবার ভাবা উচিত, আজকাল মেয়ে না মেয়ের বাবাও চাই টাকাওয়ালা জামাই।মেয়ের বাবা মেয়ের সুখের জন্য যার টাকা বেশি তার কাছে মেয়েকে বিয়ে দিবে।কখনো গরিবের কাছে মেয়ে বিয়ে দিবে না।এখন বিয়ে করতে মেয়ে দেখতে গেলে বলে ছেলে কি করে, কত টাকা বেতন পায়।.তাহলে আজকাল প্রেমের পেছনে না ছুটে নিজের পেছনে ছুটা উচিত।কেননা নিজের পেছনে পরে রয়েছে নিজের পরিবার।তারা চেয়ে অাছে আপনার প্রতি।আপনি মানুষের মতন মানুষ হবেন, পরিবারকে সুখি করবেন।সবাই আপনার দিকে চেয়ে আছে।আর আপনি এই সময় মেয়ে নিয়ে প্রেমে ডুবে আছেন নইতো নির্ঘুম রাত কাটাচ্ছেন।দরকার কি এসবের।.নিজের পরিবারের সাথে কিছু সময় দিন ও পরিবারকে নিয়ে একটু ভাবুন দেখবেন কতটা কষ্ট ও কতটা দুঃখ অভাব জড়িয়ে আছে আপনার পরিবারে।কতটা কষ্টে তারা আপনাকে বড় করছে।নিরবে একসময় ভাবতে থাকুন বাবা মায়ের কথা।দেখবেন মাথার সব ধরনের পাগলামি গুলো হারিয়ে যাবে।রাতে ঘুম নষ্ট করে অন্যের মেয়েকে পাহারা না দিয়ে নিজের পরিবারকে সময় দিন দেখুন আপনাকে ভালোবাসার মানুষের অভাব হবে না।. collected

ধনী হওয়ার ৯ টি সফল টিপস : ধনী হওয়ার পথটা কোনো গোপন বিষয় নয়। ধনী মানুষদের বিভিন্ন বিষয় বিশ্লেষণ করে যা পাওয়া গেছে তার মধ্যে আছে একনিষ্ঠ পরিশ্রম আর কয়েকটি মূলমন্ত্র। লটারির টিকিট কেনার মতো সহজ পন্থায় সবাই ধনী হতে চায়। কিন্তু বাস্তবে তা খুব কম মানুষের ভাগ্যেই জোটে। বাস্তবে যে মূলমন্ত্র দিয়ে মানুষ ধনী হয়, তা থাকছে এ নিবন্ধে। ১. শূন্য থেকে শুরু করে সংগ্রামের মধ্য দিয়ে বেড়ে উঠুন বহু সফল ব্যক্তি খালি হাতেই তাদের কাজ শুরু করেছিলেন। স্টারবাকস প্রতিষ্ঠাতা ও সিইও হাওয়ার্ড স্কুলজ ও গোল্ডম্যান সাক্স-এর সিইও লয়েড ব্ল্যাংকফেইন বড় হয়েছেন এভাবেই। প্রতিযোগিতা ও দুর্ভাগ্য তৈরি করে বড় নেতা। ২. যা ভালো লাগে, তাই করুন আপনার নিজের ভালোলাগার বিষয় করুন এবং তার বাজারের জন্য প্রার্থনা করুন। অ্যাপলের প্রতিষ্ঠাতা স্টিভ জবস বলেন, ‘সবচেয়ে ভালো কাজের একমাত্র উপায় হল নিজের কাজকে ভালোবাসা। আপনি যদি এটা না পেয়ে থাকেন তাহলে খুঁজতে থাকুন। স্থীর হবেন না।’ তিনি ঠিকই বলেছিলেন। আপনি যদি নিজের আগ্রহের বিষয়ে কাজ করেন তাহলে গ্রাহকরাও আপনাকে খুঁজে বের করবে। আর এভাবে টাকাও খুঁজে বের করবে আপনাকে। ৩. সিলিকন ভ্যালি অনুসরণ করুন যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের হাইটেক ইন্ডাস্ট্রির কেন্দ্র সিলিকন ভ্যালি বহু মানুষের ভাগ্য ফিরিয়েছে। শুধু প্রধান নির্বাহীরাই নয়, বহু চাকরিজীবীও এখানে খুব ভালো আছেন। এর কারণ প্রযুক্তি প্রতিষ্ঠানগুলো হয়ে উঠেছে বহু মানুষের সমৃদ্ধির সোপান। ৪. নিজের ব্যবসা শুরু করুন, সন্নাসীর মতো থাকুন নতুন ব্যবসা শুরু করে নিজে একজন সন্নাসীর মতো জীবন নির্বাহ করুন। আমেরিকার মিলিয়নেয়ারদের মধ্যে দুই তৃতীয়াংশই আত্মকর্মসংস্থানের মাধ্যমে এ অবস্থায় এসেছেন। তাদের অধিকাংশই আবার ছোট ব্যবসা করেন আর তাদের সামর্থের চেয়ে কম অর্থে জীবন নির্বাহ করেন। তবে তাদের অর্থ তারা আবার ব্যবসায় বিনিয়োগ করেন। সাধারণত তারা পূর্বপুরুষের কাছ থেকে কোনো অর্থ পাননি। তাই কেনার আগে আরেকবার চিন্তা করুন- আপনার কি নতুন গাড়ি বা দামি যন্ত্রটা লাগবেই? ৫. ঝুঁকি নিন, ভুল করুন, নিজের ওপর বিশ্বাস রাখুন অধিকাংশ মানুষ অবিবেচনাপ্রসূত অথবা সাধ্যের অতিরিক্ত ঝুঁকি নিয়ে ফেলে, যা তাদের নেয়া উচিত নয়। তার বদলে স্মার্ট ঝুঁকি নিতে হবে, যা বাস্তবে পূরণ করা সম্ভব। নিজের ওপর বিশ্বাস রেখে সামনে এগিয়ে যান। ভুল হলেও তা স্বাভাবিক। আঘাত না পেয়ে কেউ সামনে এগোতে পারে না। ৬. অনেক ত্যাগ করে সর্বশক্তি দিয়ে কাজ করুন ইয়াহুর সিইও মেরিসা মেয়ার খুবই পরিশ্রমি একজন নারী। তিনি সপ্তাহে ৯০ ঘণ্টা কাজ করেন। আর এলন মাস্ক দুটি প্রতিষ্ঠা চালান। একই বিষয় প্রযোজ্য ছিল স্টিভ জবসের ক্ষেত্রে। তিনি অ্যাপল ও পিক্সার চালাতেন। আপনি যা বিনিয়োগ করবেন তার ফলাফল পাবেন। ৭. নিজের ভাগ্য নিজেই তৈরি করুন এটা বলা হয় যে, সুযোগ যখন প্রস্তুতির সঙ্গে মিলে যায় তখন সৌভাগ্য আসে। আমি খুব ভাগ্যবান – এ কথার পাশাপাশি এটাও সত্য যে আমি ভাগ্য খোঁজার কাজে কখনো থামিনি। আর যখনই কোনো সুযোগের আশা মিলেছে তা হারাইনি। এ কারণে অপ্রয়োজনীয় কাজ বাদ দিয়ে বাস্তব জগতের সফল মানুষদের সঙ্গে পরিচিত হতে হবে। ৮. স্থিতিশীল বিবাহিত জীবন বিয়ে ভাঙার পর বহু ধনী মানুষের সম্পত্তি কমে গেছে। এ কারণে ধনী হওয়া ও থাকার জন্য স্থিতিশীল বিবাহিত জীবন গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। ৯. বৈচিত্র্য আনুন বহু ধরনের ধারণা আনুন নিজের কাজে। এতে অনেক কষ্ট ও সময় ব্যয় হতে পারে। তবে প্রাথমিকভাবে কষ্ট হলেও ভবিষ্যতে এর সুফল অবশ্যই পাবেন। . #শেয়ার করুন . #fahim

বন্ধুত্ব করতে চান তাহলে দেখুন আল্লাহর এবং রাসূল (সাঃ) এর পথনির্দেশ . বন্ধু কেমন হবে এ সম্পর্কে ইমাম গাযালী(র) বলেছেন,"যার সাথে বন্ধুত্ব করবে তাঁর মধ্যে পাঁচটি গুন থাকা চাই। . ১.বুদ্ধিমত্তা ২.সৎ স্বভাব, ৩.পাপাচারী না হওয়া, ৪.বিদআতী না হওয়া, ৫.দুনিয়াসক্ত না হওয়া। . প্রবাদে আছে,"নির্বোধ বন্ধুর চেয়ে বুদ্ধিমান শত্রুও ভালো" . আল্লাহ বলেন"যে আমার কাছে ফিরে আসে তার পথ অনুসরণ কর।" . আল্লাহ তায়ালা আরও বলেন"হে ইমানদারগণ! তোমরা আল্লাহকে ভয় কর এবং সত্যবাদীদের সঙ্গী হও।" . মহানবি (সাঃ) বলেন,"মানুষ তার বন্ধুর ধর্ম(আচরণ)দ্বারা প্রভাবিত।সুতরাং কার সঙ্গে বন্ধুত্ব করছ তা যাচাই করে নিবে।" . রাসূল(সাঃ)আরও বলেছেন,"অসৎ সঙ্গীর চেয়ে একাকীত্ব ভালো।আর একাকীত্বের চেয়ে সৎ সঙ্গী ভালো।"অন্যত্র বলেছেন,"যে যেই জাতির অনুকরণ করে সে ঐ জাতির মধ্যে গন্য হবে।" . সমাজে একটা কথা প্রচলিত আছে--"সৎ সঙ্গে স্বর্গবাস,অসৎ সঙ্গে সর্বনাশ।" . সৎ মানুষ অসৎ মানুষের সাথে মিশলে ঐ সৎ মানুষের অসৎ হওয়ার আশঙ্কা ৯৯% থাকে,অপর দিকে অসৎ মানুষ টার সৎ হওয়ার সম্ভবনা মাত্র ১%। . তাই আসুন বন্ধুত্ব করার আগে ভেবে দেখি আসলেই আমি কি তার বন্ধু হওয়া উপযুক্ত।
ঝগড়া করলে আপনার সাথে করে..রাগ করলে আপনার সাথে করে.. অভিমান করলে আপনার সাথে করে..সন্দেহ করলে আপনাকে করে..আর আপনি এতে খুব বিরক্ত হন?
হযরত আবু হুরায়রা রা. রাসূল সা. এর ইরশাদ বর্ণনা করেন- "মানুষ এমন একটি যুগ অতিক্রম করবে, যখন তারা (দাম্ভিকতা ও লোভের কারণে) এ পরোয়া করবে না যে, সে যা গ্রহণ করছে তা হালাল নাকি হারাম।" - [সাহীহ বুখারী: ১/২৭৬]

জান্নাত চাওয়া ও জাহান্নাম থেকে বাচার দোয়া:- -------- আনাস (রাঃ) বলেনঃ, “আল্লাহর রাসুল (সাঃ) বলেছেন, ‘যে ব্যক্তি ৩ বার আল্লাহর নিকট জান্নাত চায়, জান্নাত তখন বলে :“হে আল্লাহ্! ঐ ব্যাক্তিকে জান্নাতে প্রবেশ করাও। পক্ষান্তরে যে ব্যাক্তি ৩ বার জাহান্নামের আগুন থেকে মুক্তি চেয়ে দোয়া করে, জাহান্নাম বলে : ‘হে আল্লাহ্ ঐ ব্যাক্তিকে দোযখের আগুন থেকে মুক্তি দাও ।” (তিরমিযী, নাসায়ী, ইবনু মাজাহ- হাদীস সহীহ) : জান্নাত চাওয়া ও জাহান্নাম থেকে বাচার দোয়া:- --------- (আল্লা-হুম্মা ইন্নী আসআলুকাল জান্নাতা ওয়া আ‘উযু বিকা মিনান্নার)। “হে আল্লাহ! আমি আপনার কাছে জান্নাত চাই এবং জাহান্নাম থেকে আপনার কাছে আশ্রয় চাই”। (সহীহ-আবু দাউদ)।
জীবনে অতি সৎ হইও না। কারন জঙ্গলের সবথেকে সোজা গাছটাকেই প্রথমে কাটা হয়। ঠিক তেমনই, অতি সৎ ব্যাক্তিরাই বেশি বিপদে পরে। #___চানক্য

গল্পঃ__স্বপ্ন-- onik hasan (পড়া চোর)- .এমনিতেই কলেজের প্রথম দিন।তারপরও দেরি হয়ে গেলো।কলেজের গেইটে ঢুকতেই একটা বিশাল আকারের ধাক্কা খেলাম।চোখ তুলে তাকিয়ে দেখি একটা মেয়ে।.মেজাজটাই খারাপ হয়ে গেল।এখন একগাদা ঝাড়ি খেতে হবে।এর চেয়ে কোনো গাছের সাথে ধাক্কা খেলে ভালো হতো।.আমি সরি বলতে যাব এমন সময় মেয়েটাই উল্টো আমাকে সরি বলল।মেয়েটার সরি শুনে আমি নিজের কানকে বিশ্বাস করতে পারছি না।এই মেয়ে কি ভিনগ্রহের মানুষ?

বিয়ের একমাস পর বৌ-শাশুড়ির কথোপকথন:  →বউমা, আমি ২৮টি বছরে যা পারিনি তুমি এক মাসেই তা করে ফেলেছ। →আম্মু,আপনি এ কী বলছেন! →হ্যাঁ মা,, আমি এই ২৮টি বছরে ছেলেকে ফজর নামাজে অভ্যস্ত করতে পারিনি। তুমি এক মাসেই পেরেছ! →আম্মু, আপনি কি পাথর আর স্বর্ণের গল্পটা জানেন? →না তো! →কোন এক গ্রামে চলাচলের পথে একটি বড় পাথর প্রতিবন্ধক হয়ে দাঁড়াল। এক ব্যক্তি রাস্তা পরিস্কার করতে মনস্থ করল। সে একটি কুড়াল নিয়ে পাথরটি ভাঙার চেষ্টা করল। ৯৯টি আঘাত করে সে ক্লান্ত হয়ে গেল। তখনই সেখান দিয়ে এক পথিক যাচ্ছিল। লোকটি পথিকের সাহায্য চাইলো। পথিক কুড়াল নিয়ে আঘাত করতেই পাথরটি ভেঙে গেল এবং ভেতর থেকে স্বর্ণভর্তি একটি থলে বেরিয়ে এল। -পথিক: যেহেতু পাথরটি আমার আঘাতে ভেঙেছে, তাই থলেটি আমার। -আমাকেও কিছু দাও।আমিও যে ৯৯টি আঘাত করলাম। পথিক রাজি হল না। দুজনে কাজীর কাছে গেল। সব শোনে কাজী মীমাংসা করলেন। স্বর্ণগুলোকে ১০০ভাগ করে ১ভাগ দিলেন পথিককে, বাকি ৯৯ভাগ লোকটিকে দিয়ে দিলেন এবং বললেন, "যদি তোমার ৯৯টি আঘাত না হত তাহলে এই পাথরটি ভাঙতোই না"। -আম্মু,আপনি ২৮টি বছর পরিশ্রম করে সবকিছু প্রস্তুত করেছেন। আমি শুধু শেষ আঘাতটাই করেছি। বউ-শাশুরীর সম্পর্কগুলো এরকম মধুর হলে কোন পরিবারেই অশান্তি থাকতো না।
